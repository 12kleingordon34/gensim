The Negev in the Year 2000\\n\\nJust after the creation of the State of Israel, the phrase \"the\\nJewish pioneers will make the desert bloom\" was trumpeted\\nthroughout the Western world. After the Six Day War in 1967, David\\nBen-Gurion declared in a letter to Charles de Gaulle: \"It\\'s by our\\npioneering creation that we have transformed a poor and arid land\\ninto a fertile land, created built-up areas, towns and villages in\\nabandoned desert areas\".\\n\\nContrary to Ben-Gurion\\'s assertion, it must be affirmed that\\nduring the 26 years of the British mandate over Palestine and for\\ncenturies previous, a productive human presence was to be found in\\nall parts of the Negev desert - in the very arid hills and valleys\\nof the southern Negev as well as in the more fertile north. These\\nwere the Bedouin Arabs.\\n\\nThe real desertification of the Negev, mainly in the southern\\npart, occurred after Israel\\'s dispossession of the Bedouin\\'s\\ncultivated lands and pastures. Nowadays, the majority of the\\n12,800 square-kilometer Negev, which represents 62 percent of the\\nState of Israel (pre-1967 borders), has been desertified beyond\\nrecognition. The main new occupiers of the formerly Bedouin Negev\\nare the Israeli army; the Nature Reserves Authority, whose chief\\nrole is to prevent Bedouin from roaming their former pasture\\nlands; and vast industrial zones, including nuclear reactors and\\ndumping grounds for chemical, nuclear and other wastes. Israeli\\nJews in the Negev today cultivate less than half the surface area\\ncultivated by the Bedouin before 1948, and there is no Jewish\\npastoral activity.\\n\\nI. Agricultural and pastoral activities of the Negev Bedouin\\nbefore and after 1948\\n-------------------------------------------------- In 1942,\\naccording to British mandatory statistics, the Beersheba\\nsub-district (which corresponds more or less to Israel\\'s Negev, or\\nSouthern, district) had 52,000 inhabitants, almost all Bedouin\\nArabs, who held 11,500 camels, 6,000 cows and oxen, 42,000 sheep\\nand 22,000 goats.\\n\\nThe majority of the Bedouin lived a more or less sedentary life in\\nthe north, where precipitation ranged between 200 and 350 mm per\\nyear. In 1944 they cultivated about 200,000 hectares of the\\nBeersheba district - i.e. 16 percent of its total area and *more\\nthan double the area cultivated by the Negev\\'s Jewish settlers\\nafter 40 years of \"making the desert bloom\"*\\n\\nThe Bedouin had a very low crop yield - 350 to 400 kilograms of\\nbarley per hectare during rainy years - and their farming\\ntechniques were primitive, but production was based solely on\\nanimal and human labor. It must also be underscored that animal\\nproduction, although low, was based entirely on pasturing.\\nProduction increased considerably during the rainy years and\\ndiminished significantly during drought years. All Bedouin pasture\\nanimals - goats, camels and sheep - had the ability to gain weight\\nquickly over the relatively rainy winters and to withstand many\\nwaterless days during the hot summers. These animals were the\\nresult of a centuries-old process of natural selection in harsh\\nlocal conditions.\\n\\nAfter the creation of the State of Israel, 80 percent of the Negev\\nBedouin were expelled to the Sinai or to Southern Jordan. The\\n10,000 who were allowed to remain were confined to a territory of\\n40,000 hectares in a region were annual mean precipiation was 150\\nmm - a quantity low enough to ensure a crop failure two years out\\nof three. The rare water wells in the south and central Negev,\\nspring of life in the desert, were cemented to prevent Bedouin\\nshepherds from roaming.\\n\\nA few Bedouin shepherds were allowed to stay in the central Negev.\\nBut after 1982, when the Sinai was returned to Egypt, these\\nBedouin were also eliminated. At the same time, strong pressure\\nwas applied on the Bedouin to abandon cultivation of their fields\\nin order that the land could be transferred to the army.\\n\\nNo reliable statistics exist concerning the amount of land held\\ntoday by Negev Bedouin. It is a known fact that a large part of\\nthe 40,000 hectares they cultivated in the 1950s has been seized\\nby the Israeli authorities. Indeed, most of the Bedouin are now\\nconfined to seven \"development towns\", or *sowetos*, established\\nfor them.\\n\\n(the rest of the article is available from Elias Davidsson, email:\\nelias@ismennt.is)\\n\\n',\n",

The\\nfirst is that of Israel, where there is little trust for Arab groups, so\\nthere is little support for Israel giving up **tangible** assets in \\nexchange for pieces of paper, \"expectations\", \"hopes\", etc. The second\\nis that of the Arab world/Palestinians, where there is the demand that\\nthese \"tangible concessions\" be made by Israel **without** it receiving\\nanything **tangible** back.  Given this, the gap between the two stances\\nseems to be the need by Israel of receiving some ***tangible*** returns\\nfor its expected concessions. By \"tangible\" is meant something that\\n1) provides Israel with \"comparable\" protection (from the land it is to \\ngive up), 2) in some way ensures that the Arab states and Palestine \\n**will be** accountable and held actively (not just \"diplomatically) \\nresponsible for the upholding of all actions on its territory (by citizens \\nor \"visitors\").\\n\\nIn essence I do not believe that Israel objections to Palestinian\\nstatehood would be anywhere near as strong as they are now IF Israel\\nwas assured that any new Palestinian state *would be committed to** \\nco-existing with Israel and held responsible for ALL attacks on Israel \\nfrom its territory.\\n\\tAside from some of the rather slanted proposals above,\\n\\thow *could* such \"guarantees\" be instilled?

If we\\ndon\\'t, we become uncompetitive.\\n\\nFrom the user perspective, you have to buy a machine that meets your\\ncurrent needs and makes economic sense today.  You can\\'t wait to buy, but\\nif you need a guaranteed upgrade path for the machine, ask the Sales Rep\\nfor one in writing. If it\\'s feasible, they should be able to do that. Some\\nof our upgrade paths have specific programs associated with them, such as\\nthe Performance Protection Program for older R3000-based Power Series\\nmultiprocessing systems which allowed purchasers of those systems to obtain\\na guaranteed upgrade price for moving to the new Onyx or Challenge\\nR4400-based 64-bit multiprocessor systems.\\n\\n|> \\n|> Now I understand that SGI is responsible to its investors and has to\\n|> keep showing a positive quarterly bottom line (odd that I found myself\\n|> pressured on at least two occasions to get the business on the books\\n|> just before the end of the quarter), but I\\'m just a little tired of\\n|> getting boned in the process.\\n|> \\n\\nIf that\\'s happening, it\\'s becausing of misunderstandings or\\nmis-communication, not because SGI is directly attempting to annoy our\\ncustomer base.\\n\\n|> Maybe it\\'s because my lab buys SGIs in onesies and twosies, so we\\n|> aren\\'t entitled to a \"peek under the covers\" as the Big Kids (NASA,\\n|> for instance) are.

Gibbons, Director, Office of Science and Technology\\nPolicy, outlined to the members-designate of the Advisory Committee on the\\nRedesign of the Space Station on April 3, three budget options as guidance\\nto the committee in their deliberations on the redesign of the space\\nstation.\\n\\n        A low option of $5 billion, a mid-range option of $7 billion and a\\nhigh option of $9 billion will be considered by the committee.  Each\\noption would cover the total expenditures for space station from fiscal\\nyear 1994 through 1998 and would include funds for development,\\noperations, utilization, Shuttle integration, facilities, research\\noperations support, transition cost and also must include adequate program\\nreserves to insure program implementation within the available funds.\\n\\n        Over the next 5 years, $4 billion is reserved within the NASA\\nbudget for the President\\'s new technology investment.  As a result,\\nstation options above $7 billion must be accompanied by offsetting\\nreductions in the rest of the NASA budget.  For example, a space station\\noption of $9 billion would require $2 billion in offsets from the NASA\\nbudget over the next 5 years.\\n\\n        Gibbons presented the information at an organizational session of\\nthe advisory committee.  Generally, the members-designate focused upon\\nadministrative topics and used the session to get acquainted.  They also\\nreceived a legal and ethics briefing and an orientation on the process the\\nStation Redesign Team is following to develop options for the advisory\\ncommittee to consider.\\n\\n        Gibbons also announced that the United States and its\\ninternational partners -- the Europeans, Japanese and Canadians -- have\\ndecided, after consultation, to give \"full consideration\" to use of\\nRussian assets in the course of the space station redesign process.\\n\\n        To that end, the Russians will be asked to participate in the\\nredesign effort on an as-needed consulting basis, so that the redesign\\nteam can make use of their expertise in assessing the capabilities of MIR\\nand the possible use of MIR and other Russian capabilities and systems.\\nThe U.S. and international partners hope to benefit from the expertise of\\nthe Russian participants in assessing Russian systems and technology.  The\\noverall goal of the redesign effort is to develop options for reducing\\nstation costs while preserving key research and exploration capabilitiaes.\\nCareful integration of Russian assets could be a key factor in achieving\\nthat goal.\\n\\n        Gibbons reiterated that, \"President Clinton is committed to the\\nredesigned space station and to making every effort to preserve the\\nscience, the technology and the jobs that the space station program\\nrepresents.  However, he also is committed to a space station that is well\\nmanaged and one that does not consume the national resources which should\\nbe used to invest in the future of this industry and this nation.\"\\n\\n        NASA Administrator Daniel S.  Goldin said the Russian\\nparticipation will be accomplished through the East-West Space Science\\nCenter at the University of Maryland under the leadership of Roald\\nSagdeev.\\n\\n------- End of Blind-Carbon-Copy\\n',\n",

Mitchell\\n                          March 23, 1993\\n \\nINTRODUCTION:\\n \\nIn order to increase public interest in space-based and lunar operations, a\\nreal miniature lunar-like environment is being constructed on which to test\\ntele-operated models. These models are remotely-controlled by individuals\\nlocated world-wide using their personal computers, for EduTainment\\npurposes.\\nNot only does this provide a test-bed for simple tele-operation and\\ntele-presence activities but it also provides for the sharing of\\ninformation\\non methods of operating in space, including, but not limited to, layout of\\na\\nlunar colony, tele-operating machines for work and play, disseminating\\neducational information, providing contests and awards for creativity and\\nachievement and provides a new way for students worldwide to participate in\\nTwenty-First century remote learning methods.\\n \\nBecause of the nature of the LTM1 project, people of all ages, interests\\nand\\nskills can contribute scenery and murals, models and structures,\\ninterfacing\\nand electronics, software and graphics. In operation LTM1 is an evolving\\nplayground and laboratory that can be used by children, students and\\nprofessionals worldwide. Using a personal computer at home or a terminal at\\na participating institution a user is able to tele-operate real models at\\nthe\\nLTM1 base for experimental or recreational purposes. Because a real\\nfacility\\nexists, ample opportunity is provided for media coverage of the\\nconstruction\\nof the lunar model, its operation and new features to be added as suggested\\nby the users themselves.\\n \\nThis has broad inherent interest for a wide range of groups:\\n - tele-operations and virtual reality research\\n - radio control, model railroad and ham radio operation\\n - astronomy and space planetariums and science centers\\n - art and theater\\n - bbs and online network users\\n - software and game developers\\n - manufacturers and retailers of model rockets, cars and trains\\n - children\\n - the child in all of us\\n \\nLTM1 OVERALL DESIGN:\\n \\nA room 14 feet by 8 feet contains the base lunar layout. The walls are used\\nfor murals of distant moon mountains, star fields and a view of the earth.\\nThe \"floor\" is the simulated lunar surface. A global call for contributions\\nis hereby made for material for the lunar surface, and for the design and\\ncreation of scale models of lunar colony elements, scenery, and\\nmachine-lets.\\n \\n The LTM1 initial design has 3 tele-operated machinelets:\\n 1. An SSTO scale model which will be able to lift off, hover and land;\\n 2. A bulldozerlet which will be able to move about in a quarry area; and\\n 3. A moon-train which will traverse most of the simulated lunar surface.\\n \\n Each machinelet has a small TV camera utilizing a CCD TV chip mounted on\\n it. A personal computer digitizes the image (including reducing picture\\n content and doing data-compression to allow for minimal images to be sent\\n to the operator for control purposes) and also return control signals.\\n \\nThe first machinelet to be set up will be the moon-train since model trains\\nwith TV cameras built in are almost off-the-shelf items and control\\nelectronics for starting and stopping a train are minimal. The user will\\nreceive an image once every 1 to 4 seconds depending on the speed of their\\ndata link to LTM1.\\n \\nNext, an SSTO scale model with a CCD TV chip will be suspended from a\\nservo-motor operated wire frame mounted on the ceiling allowing for the\\nSSTO\\nto be controlled by the operator to take off, hover over the entire lunar\\nlandscape and land.\\n \\nFinally, some tank models will be modified to be CCD TV chip equipped\\nbulldozerlets. The entire initial LTM1 will allow remote operators\\nworldwide\\nto receive minimal images while actually operating models for landing and\\ntakeoff, traveling and doing work. The entire system is based on\\ncommercially\\navailable items and parts that can be easily obtained except for the\\ninterface electronics which is well within the capability of many advanced\\nham radio operator and computer hardware/software developers.\\n \\nBy taking a graphically oriented communications program (Dmodem) and adding\\na tele-operations screen and controls, the necessary user interface can be\\nprovided in under 80 man hours.\\n \\nPLAN OF ACTION:\\n \\nThe Diaspar Virtual Reality Network has agreed to sponsor this project by\\nproviding a host computer network and Internet access to that network.\\nDiaspar is providing the 14 foot by 8 foot facility for actual construction\\nof the lunar model. Diaspar has, in stock, the electronic tanks that can be\\nmodified and one CCD TV chip. Diaspar also agrees to provide \"rail stock\"\\nfor the lunar train model. Diaspar will make available the Dmodem graphical\\ncommunications package and modify it for control of the machines-lets.\\nAn initial \"ground breaking\" with miniature shovels will be performed for\\na live photo-session and news conference on April 30, 1993. The initial\\nmodels will be put in place. A time-lapse record will be started for\\nhistorical purposes. It is not expected that this event will be completely\\nserious or solemn. The lunar colony will be declared open for additional\\nbuilding, operations and experiments. A photographer will be present and\\nthe photographs taken will be converted to .gif images for distribution\\nworld-wide to major online networks and bbs\\'s. A press release will be\\nissued\\ncalling for contributions of ideas, time, talent, materials and scale\\nmodels\\nfor the simulated lunar colony.\\n \\nA contest for new designs and techniques for working on the moon will then\\nbe\\nannounced. Universities will be invited to participate, the goal being to\\nfind instructors who wish to have class participation in various aspects of\\nthe lunar colony model. Field trips to LTM1 can be arranged and at that\\ntime\\nthe results of the class work will be added to the model. Contributors will\\nthen be able to tele-operate any contributed machine-lets once they return\\nto\\ntheir campus.\\n \\nA monthly LTM1 newsletter will be issued both electronically online and via\\nconventional means to the media. Any major new tele-operated equipment\\naddition will be marked with an invitation to the television news media.\\nHaving a large, real model space colony will be a very attractive photo\\nopportunity for the television community. Especially since the \"action\"\\nwill\\nbe controlled by people all over the world. Science fiction writers will be\\ninvited to issue \"challenges\" to engineering and human factors students at\\nuniversities to build and operate the tele-operated equipment to perform\\nlunar tasks. Using counter-weight and pulley systems, 1/6 gravity may be\\nsimulated to some extent to try various traction challenges.\\n \\nThe long term goal is creating world-wide interest, education,\\nexperimentation\\nand remote operation of a lunar colony. LTM1 has the potential of being a\\nlong\\nterm global EduTainment method for space activities and may be the generic\\nexample of how to teach and explore in many other subject areas not limited\\nto space EduTainment. All of this facilitates the kind of spirit which can\\nlead to a generation of people who are ready for the leap to the stars!\\n \\nCONCLUSION:\\n \\nEduTainment is the blending of education and entertainment. Anyone who has\\never enjoyed seeing miniatures will probably see the potential impact of a\\nglobally available layout for recreation, education and experimentation\\npurposes. By creating a tele-operated model lunar colony we not only create\\nworld-wide publicity, but also a method of trying new ideas that require\\nreal\\n(not virtual) skills and open a new method for putting people\\'s minds in\\nspace.\\n \\n \\nMOONLIGHTERS:\\n \\n\"Illuminating the path of knowledge about space and lunar development.\"\\nThe following people are already engaged in various parts of this work:\\nDavid42, Rob47, Dash, Hyson, Jzer0, Vril, Wyatt, The Dark One, Tiggertoo,\\nThe Mad Hatter, Sir Robin, Jogden.\\n \\nCome join the discussion any Friday night from 10:30 to midnight PST in\\n \\nDiaspar Virtual Reality Network.

Zionism agrees with the basic tenet\\nof anti-Semitism, namely that Jews cannot live with non- Jews.\\n\\nThe history and roots of the Holocaust go back a long way. While\\nthe industru of death and destruction did not operate before 1942,\\nits roots were firmly placed in the 19th Century. Jewish\\naspirations for emancipation emerged out of the national struggles\\nin Europe. When the hopes for liberation through\\nbourgeois-democratic change were dashed, other alternatives for\\nimproving the lot of the Jews of Europe achieved prominence.\\n\\nThe socialist Bund, a mass movement with enormous following, had\\nto contend with opposition from a new and small, almost\\ninsignificant opponent, the political Zionists.  In outline these\\ntwo offered diametrically opposed options for Jews in Europe.\\nWhile the Bund was suggesting joining forces with the rest of\\nEurope\\'s workers, the Zionists were proposing a new programme\\naimed at ridding Europe of its Jews by setting up some form of a\\nJewish state.\\n\\nHistorically, nothing is inevitable, all depends on the balance of\\nforces involved in the struggle. History can be seen as an option\\ntree: every time a certain option is chosen, other routes become\\nbarred. Because of that choice, movement backwards to the point\\nbefore that choice was made is impossible. While Zionism as an\\noption was taken by many young Jews, it remained a minority\\nposition until the first days of the 3rd Reich. The Zionist\\nFederation of Germany (ZVfD), an organisation representing a tiny\\nminority of German Jews, was selected by the Nazis as the body to\\nrepresent the Jews of the Reich. Its was the only flag of an\\ninterantional organisation allowed to fly in Berlin, and this was\\nthe only international organisation allowed to operate during this\\nperiod. From a marginal position, the leaders of the Zionist\\nFederation were propelled to a prominence and centrality that\\nsurprised even them. All of a sudden they attained political\\npower, power based not on representation, but from being selected\\nas the choice of the Nazi regime for dealing with the the \\'Jewish\\nproblem\\'. Their position in negotiating with the Nazis agreements\\nthat affected the lives of many tens of thousands of the Jews in\\nGermany transformed them from a utopian, marginal organisation in\\nGermany (and some other countries in Europe) into a real option to\\nbe considered by German Jews.\\n\\nThe best example of this was the \\'Transfer Agreement\\' of 1934.\\nImmediately after the Nazi takeover in 1933, Jews all over the\\nworld supported or were organising a world wide boycott of German\\ngoods. This campaign hurt the Nazi regime and the German\\nauthorities searched frantically for a way disabling the boycott.\\nIt was clear that if Jews and Jewish organisations were to pull\\nout, the campaign would collapse.\\n\\nThis problem was solved by the ZVfD. A letter sent to the Nazi\\nparty as early as 21.  June 1933, outlined the degree of agreement\\nthat existed between the two organisations on the question of\\nrace, nation, and the nature of the \\'Jewish problem\\', and it\\noffered to collaborate with the new regime:\\n\\n\"The realisation of Zionism could only be hurt by resentment of\\nJews abroad against the German development. Boycott propaganda -\\nsuch as is currently being carried out against Germany in many\\nways - is in essence unZionist, because Zionism wants not to do\\nbattle but to convince and build.\"\\n\\nIn their eagerness to gain credence and the backing of the new\\nregime, the Zionist organisation managed to undermine the boycott.\\nThe main public act was the signature of the \"Transfer Agreement\"\\nwith the Nazi authorities during the Zionist Congress of 1934. In\\nessence, the agreement was designed to get Germany\\'s Jews out of\\nthe country and into Mandate Palestine. It provided a possibility\\nfor Jews to take a sizeable part of their property out of the\\ncountry, through a transfer of German goods to Palestine. This\\nright was denied to Jews leaving to any other destination. The\\nZionist organisation was the acting agent, through its financial\\norganisations. This agreement operated on a number of fronts -\\n\\'helping\\' Jews to leave the country, breaking the ring of the\\nboycott, exporting German goods in large quantities to Palestine,\\nand last but not least, enabling the regime to be seen as humane\\nand reasonable even towards its avowed enemies, the Jews. After\\nall, they argued, the Jews do not belong in Europe and now the\\nJews come and agree with them.\\n\\nAfter news of the agreement broke, the boycott was doomed. If the\\nZionist Organization found it possible and necessary to deal with\\nthe Nazis, and import their goods, who could argue for a boycott ?\\nThis was not the first time that the interests of both movements\\nwere presented to the German public as complementary. Baron Von\\nMildenstein, the first head of the Jewish Department of the SS,\\nlater followed by Eichmann, was invited to travel to Palestine.\\nThis he did in early 1933, in the company of a Zionist leader,\\nKurt Tuchler. Having spent six months in Palestine, he wrote a\\nseries of favourable articles in Der STURMER describing the \\'new\\nJew\\' of Zionism, a Jew Nazis could accept and understand.\\n\\nThis little-known episode established quite clearly the\\nrelationship during the early days of Nazism, between the new\\nregime and the ZVfD, a relationship that was echoed later in a\\nnumber of key instances, even after the nature of the Final\\nSolution became clear. In many cases this meant a silencing of\\nreports about the horrors of the exterminations. A book\\nconcentrating on this aspect of the Zionist reaction to the\\nHolocaust is Post-Ugandan Zionism in the Crucible of the\\nHolocaust, by S. B. Beth-Zvi.\\n\\nIn the case of the Kastner episode, around which Jim Allen\\'s play\\nPERDITION is based, even the normal excuse of lack of knowledge of\\nthe real nature of events does not exist. It occured near the end\\nof the war. The USSR had advanced almost up to Germany. Italy and\\nthe African bases had been lost. The Nazis were on the run, with a\\nnumber of key countries, such as Rumania, leaving the Axis. A\\nsecond front was a matter of months away, as the western Allies\\nprepared their forces. In the midst of all this we find Eichmann,\\nthe master bureaucrat of industrial murder, setting up his HZ in\\noccupied Budapest, after the German takeover of the country in\\nApril 1944. His first act was to have a conference with the Jewish\\nleadership, and to appoint Zionist Federation members, headed by\\nKastner as the agent and clearing house for all Jews and their\\nrelationship with the SS and the Nazr authorities. Why they did\\nthis is not difficult to see. As opposed to Poland, where its\\nthree and  a half million Jews lived in ghettoes and were visibly\\ndifferent from the rest of the Polish population, the Hungarian\\nJews were an integrated part of the community. The middle class\\nwas mainly Jewish, the Jews were mainly middle-class. They enjoyed\\nfreedom of travel, served in the Hungarian (fascist) army in\\nfronline units, as officers and soldiers, their names were\\nHungarian - how was Eichmann to find them if they were to be\\nexterminated ? The task was not easy, there were a million Jews in\\nHungary, most of them resident, the rest being refugees from other\\ncountries. Many had  heard about the fate of Jews elsewhere, and\\nwere unlikely to believe any statements by Nazi officials.\\n\\nLike elsewhere, the only people who had the information and the\\near of the frightened Jewish population were the Judenrat. In this\\ncase the Judenrat comprsied mainly the Zionist Federation members.\\nWithout their help the SS, with 19 officers and less than 90 men,\\nplus a few hundred Hungarian police, could not have collected and\\ncontrolled a million Jews, when they did not even know their\\nwhereabouts. Kastner and the others were left under no illusions.\\nEichmann told Joel Brand, one of the members of Kastner\\'s\\ncommittee, that he intended to send all Hungary\\'s Jews to\\nAuschwitz, before he even started the expulsions!  He told them\\nclearly that all these Jews will die, 12,000 a day, unless certain\\nconditions were met.\\n\\nThe Committee faced a simple choice - to tell the Jews of Hungary\\nabout their fate, (with neutral Rumania, where many could escape,\\nbeing in most cases a few hours away) or to collaborate with the\\nNazis by assisting in the concentration process. What would not\\nhave been believed when coming from the SS, sounded quite\\nplausible when coming from the mouths of the Zionist leadership.\\nThus it is, that most of the Hungarian Jews went quietly to their\\ndeath, assured by their leadership that they were to be sent to\\nwork camps.\\n\\nTo be sure, there are thirty pieces of silver in this narrative of\\ndestruction: the trains of \\'prominents\\' which Eichmann promised to\\nKastner - a promise he kept to the last detail. For Eichmann it\\nwas a bargain: allowing 1,680 Jews to survive, as the price paid\\nfor the silent collaboration over the death of almost a million\\nJews.\\n\\nThere was no way in which the Jews of Hungary could even be\\nlocated, not to say murdered, without the full collaboration of\\nKastner and his few friends. No doubt the SS would hunt a few Jews\\nhere and there, but the scale of the operation would have been\\nminiscule compared to the half million who died in Auschwitz.\\n\\nIt is important to realise that Kastner was not an aberration,\\nlike say Rumkovsky in Lodz. Kastner acted as a result of his\\nstrongly held Zionist convictions. His actions were a logical\\noutcome of earlier positions. This is instanced when he exposed to\\nthe Gestapo the existence of a British cell of saboteurs, Palgi\\nand Senesh, and persuaded them to give themselves up, so as not to\\ndisrupt his operations. At no point during his trial or elsewhere,\\ndid Kastner deny that he knew exactly what was to happen to those\\nJews.\\n\\nTo conclude, the role played by Zionists in this period, was\\nconnected to another role they could, and should have played, that\\nof alarming the whole world to what was happening in Europe. They\\nhad the information, but politically it was contrary to their\\npriorities. The priorities were, and still are, quite simple: All\\nthat furthers the Zionist enterprise in Palestine is followed,\\nwhatever the price. The lives of individuals, Jews and non-Jews,\\nare secondary. If this process requires dealing with fascists,\\nNazis and other assorted dictatorial regimes across the world, so\\nbe it.\\n\\n',\n",

I\\'ve \\ntranscribed some of my notes below.  Since my note taking ability is by no means\\ninfallible, please assume that all factual errors are mine.  Permission is \\ngranted to copy this without restriction.\\n\\nNote for newbies:  The Delta Clipper project is geared towards producing a\\nsingle staget to orbit, reusable launch vehicle.  The DC-X vehicle is a 1/3\\nscale vehicle designed to test some of the concepts invovled in SSTO.  It is \\ncurrently undergoing tests.  The DC-Y vehicle would be a full scale \\nexperimental vehicle capable of reaching orbit.  It has not yet been funded.\\n\\nOn April 6th, Rocky Nelson of MacDonnell Douglas gave a talk entitled \\n\"Optimizing Techniques for Advanced Space Missions\" here at the University of\\nIllinois. Mr Nelson\\'s job involves using software to simulate trajectories and\\ndetermine the optimal trajectory within given requirements.  Although he is\\nnot directly involved with the Delta Clipper project, he has spent time with \\nthem recently, using his software for their applications.  He thus used \\nthe DC-Y project for most of his examples.  While I don\\'t think the details\\nof implicit trajectory simulation are of much interest to the readers (I hope\\nthey aren\\'t - I fell asleep during that part), I think that many of you will\\nbe interested in some of the details gleaned from the examples.\\n\\nThe first example given was the maximization of payload for a polar orbit.  The\\nmain restriction is that acceleration must remain below 3 Gs.  I assume that\\nthis is driven by passenger constraints rather than hardware constraints, but I\\ndid not verify that.  The Delta Clipper Y version has 8 engines - 4 boosters\\nand 4 sustainers.  The boosters, which have a lower isp, are shut down in \\nmid-flight.  Thus, one critical question is when to shut them down.  Mr Nelson\\nshowed the following plot of acceleration vs time:\\n                  ______\\n3 G         /|   /      |\\n           / |  /       |          As ASCII graphs go, this is actually fairly \\n          /  | /        |\\t   good.  The big difference is that the lines\\n2 G      /   |/         |          made by the  /  should be curves which are\\n        /               |          concave up.  The data is only approximate, as\\n       /                |          the graph wasn\\'t up for very long.\\n1 G   /                 |\\n                        |\\n                        |\\n0 G                     |\\n\\n             ^          ^\\n           ~100 sec    ~400 sec\\n\\n\\nAs mentioned before, a critical constraint is that G levels must be kept below\\n3.  Initially, all eight engines are started.  As the vehicle  burns fuel the\\naccelleration increases.  As it gets close to 3G, the booster engines are \\nthrotled back.  However, they quickly become inefficient at low power, so it\\nsoon makes more sense to cut them off altogether.  This causes the dip in \\naccelleration at about 100 seconds.  Eventually the remaining sustainer engines\\nbring the G level back up to about 3 and then hold it there until they cut\\nout entirely.\\n\\nThe engine cutoff does not acutally occur in orbit.  The trajectory is aimed\\nfor an altitude slightly higher than the 100nm desired and the last vestiges of\\nair drag slow the vehicle slightly, thus lowering the final altitude to \\nthat desired.\\n\\nQuestions from the audience:  (paraphrased)\\n\\nQ:  Would it make sense to shut down the booster engines in pairs, rather than\\n    all at once?\\n\\nA:  Very perceptive.  Worth considering.  They have not yet done the simulation.    Shutting down all four was part of the problem as given.\\n\\nQ:  So what was the final payload for this trajectory?\\n\\nA:  Can\\'t tell us.  \"Read Aviation Leak.\"  He also apparently had a good \\n    propulsion example, but was told not to use it.  \\n\\nMy question:  Does anyone know if this security is due to SDIO protecting\\nnational security or MD protecting their own interests?\\n\\nThe second example was reentry simulation, from orbit to just before the pitch\\nup maneuver.  The biggest constraint in this one is aerodynamic heating, and \\nthe parameter they were trying to maximize was crossrange.  He showed graphs\\nof heating using two different models, to show that both were very similar,\\nand I think we were supposed to assume that this meant they were very accurate.\\nThe end result was that for a polar orbit landing at KSC, the DC-Y would have\\nabout 30 degrees of crossrange and would start it\\'s reentry profile about \\n60 degrees south latitude.\\n\\nI would have asked about the landing maneuvers, but he didn\\'t know about that\\naspect of the flight profile.\\n\\n-- \\nJosh Hopkins                                          jbh55289@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu\\n\\t\\t    \"Find a way or make one.\"\\n\\t             -attributed to Hannibal\\n',\n",

Meaning: would gases \"so far\" down the line (the canister)\\n>really have an effect on the exhaust stroke?  Do the gases really \\n>compress that much?\\n\\n    For discussion purposes, I will ignore dynamic effects like pulses\\nin the exhaust pipe, and try to paint a useful mental picture.\\n\\n1.  Unless an engine is supercharged, the pressure available to force\\nair into the intake tract is _atmospheric_.  At the time the intake\\nvalve is opened, the pressure differential available to move air is only\\nthe difference between the combustion chamber pressure (left over after\\nthe exhaust stroke) and atmospheric.  As the piston decends on the\\nintake stroke, combustion chamber pressure is decreased, allowing\\natmospheric pressure to move more air into the intake tract.  At no time\\ndoes the pressure ever become \"negative\", or even approach a good\\nvacuum.\\n\\n2.  At the time of the exhaust valve closing, the pressure in the\\ncombustion chamber is essentially the pressure of the exhaust system up\\nto the first major flow restriction (the muffler).  Note that the volume\\nof gas that must flow through the exhaust is much larger than the volume\\nthat must flow through the intake, because of the temperature\\ndifference and the products of combustion.\\n\\n3.  In the last 6-8 years, the Japanese manufacturers have started\\npaying attention to exhaust and intake tuning, in pursuit of almighty\\nhorsepower.  At this point in time, on high-performance bikes,\\nsubstitution of an aftermarket free-flow air filter will have almost\\nzero affect on performance, because the stock intake system flows very\\nwell anyway.  Substitution of an aftermarket exhaust system will make\\nvery little difference, unless (in general) the new exhaust system is\\n_much_ louder than the stocker.\\n\\n4.  On older bikes,  exhaust back-pressure was the dominating factor.\\nIf free-flowing air filters were substituted, very little difference\\nwas noted, unless a free-flowing exhaust system was installed as well.\\n\\n5.  In general, an engine can be visualized as an air pump.  At any\\ngiven RPM, anything that will cause the engine to pump more air, be it\\non the intake or exhaust side, will cause it to produce more horsepower.\\nPumping more air will require recalibration (rejetting) of the carburetor.\\n\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n| Dave Tharp                      | DoD #0751   | \"You can\\'t wear out       |\\n| davet@interceptor.CDS.TEK.COM   | MRA #151    |   an Indian Scout,        |\\n| \\'88 K75S  \\'48 Indian Chief      | AHRMA #751  |  Or its brother the Chief.|\\n| \\'75 R90S(#151) \\'72 TR-2B(#751)  | AMA #524737 |  They\\'re built like rocks |\\n| \\'65 R50/2/Velorex  \\'57 NSU Max  |             |   to take the knocks,     |\\n|       1936 BMW R12              | (Compulsive | It\\'s the Harleys that     |\\n| My employer has no idea.        |   Joiner)   |   give you grief.\"        |\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n',\n",

So, the\\nfirst person to intentionally cause someone to get killed is necessarily\\na murderer.  Is this enough of an induction to solve the apparently\\nunreducable definition?

This was appraently attempted in the\\ncase of Vanunu and failed.  It has happened before, and there is reason\\nto believe it still goes on.\\n\\nRead this:\\n\\nFrom Ma\\'ariv, February 18 (possibly 28), 1992\\n\\nPUBLICATION BAN\\n\\n        The State of Israel has never officially admitted that for many\\n        years there have been in its prisons Israeli citizens who were\\n        sentenced to long prison terms without either the fact of\\n        their arrest or the crimes of which they were accused ever\\n        being made public.\\n\\nBy Baruch Me\\'iri\\n\\nAll those involved in this matter politely refused my request, one way\\nor another: \"Look, the subject is too delicate.  If I comment on it, I\\nwill be implicitly admitting that it is true; If I mention a specific\\ncase, even hint at it, I might be guilty of making public something\\nwhich may legally not be published\".\\n\\nThe State of Israel has never officially admitted that for many years\\nthere have been in its prisons Israeli citizens who were sentenced to\\nlong prison terms without either the fact of their arrest or the\\ncrimes of which they were accused ever being made public. More\\nprecisely: A court ordered publication ban was placed on the fact of\\ntheir arrest, and later on their imprisonment.\\n\\nIn Israel of 1993, citizens are imprisoned without us, the citizens of\\nthis country, knowing anything about it.  Not knowing anything about\\nthe fact that one person or another were tried and thrown in prison,\\nfor security offenses, in complete secrecy.\\n\\nIn the distant past -- for example during the days of the [Lavon - YA]\\naffair -- we heard about \"the third man\" being in prison.  But many\\nyears have passed since then, and what existed then can today no\\nlonger be found even in South American countries, or in the former\\nCommunist countries.\\n\\nBut it appears that this is still possible in Israel of 1993.\\n\\nThe Chair of the Knesset Committee on Law, the Constitution and\\nJustice, MK David Zucker, sent a letter on this subject early this\\nweek to the Prime Minister, the Minister of Justice, and the Cabinet\\nLegal Advisor.  Ma\\'ariv has obtained the content of the letter:\\n\\n\"During the past several years a number of Israeli citizens have been\\nimprisoned for various periods for security offenses.  In some of\\nthese cases a legal publication ban was imposed not only on the\\nspecifics of the crimes for which the prisoners were convicted, but\\neven on the mere fact of their imprisonment.  In those cases, after\\nbeing legally convicted, the prisoners spend their term in prison\\nwithout public awareness either of the imprisonment or of the\\nprisoner\", asserts MK Zucker.\\n\\nOn the other hand Zucker agrees in his letter that, \"There is\\nabsolutely no question that it is possible, and in some cases it is\\nimperative, that a publication ban be imposed on the specifics of\\nsecurity offenses and the course of trials.  But even in such cases\\nthe Court must weigh carefully and deliberately the circumstances\\nunder which a trial will not be held in public.\\n\\n\"However, one must ask whether the imposition of a publication ban on\\nthe mere fact of a person\\'s arrest, and on the name of a person\\nsentenced to prison, is justified and appropriate in the State of\\nIsrael.  The principle of public trial and the right of the public to\\nknow are not consistent with the disappearance of a person from public\\nsight and his descent into the abyss of prison.\"\\n\\nZucker thus decided to turn to the Prime Minister, the Minister of\\nJustice and the Cabinet Legal Advisor and request that they consider\\nthe question.  \"The State of Israel is strong enough to withstand the\\ncost incurred by abiding by the principle of public punishment.  The\\nState of Israel cannot be allowed to have prisoners whose detention\\nand its cause is kept secret\", wrote Zucker.\\n\\nThe legal counsel of the Civil Rights Union, Attorney Mordechai\\nShiffman said that, \"We, as the Civil Rights Union, do not know of any\\ncases of security prisoners, Citizens of Israel, who are imprisoned,\\nand whose imprisonment cannot be made public.  This is a situation\\nwhich, if it actually exists, is definitely unhealthy.  Just like\\ncensorship is an unhealthy matter\".\\n\\n\"The Union is aware\", says Shiffman, \"of cases where notification of a\\nsuspect\\'s arrest to family members and lawyers is withheld.  I am\\nspeaking only of several days.  I know also of cases where a detainee\\nwas not allowed to meet with an attorney -- sometimes for the whole\\nfirst month of arrest.  That is done because of the great secrecy.\\n\\n\"The suspect himself, his family, his lawyer -- or even a journalist --\\ncan challenge the publication ban in court.  But there are cases where\\nthe family members themselves are not interested in publicity.  The\\njournalist knows nothing of the arrest, and so almost everyone is\\nhappy...\"\\n\\nAttorney Yossi Arnon, an official of the Bar, claims that given the\\nlaws as they exist in Israel today, a situation where the arrest of a\\nperson for security offenses is kept secret is definitely possible. \\n\"Nothing is easier.  The court orders a publication ban, and that\\'s\\nthat.  Someone who has committed security offenses can spend long\\nyears in prison without us knowing anything about it.\"\\n\\n-- Do you find this situation acceptable?\\n\\nAttorney Arnon: \"Definitely not.  We live in a democratic country, and\\nsuch a state of affairs is impermissible.  I am well aware that\\npublication can be damaging -- from the standpoint of security -- but\\ntotal non-publication, silence, is unacceptable. Consider the trial of\\nMordechai Vanunu: at least in his case we know that he was charged\\nwith aggravated espionage and sentenced to 18 years in prison.  The\\ntrial was held behind closed doors, nobody knew the details except for\\nthose who were authorized to.  It is somehow possible to understand,\\nthough not to accept, the reasons, but, as I have noted, we at least\\nare aware of his imprisonment.\"\\n\\n-- Why is the matter actually that serious?  Can\\'t we trust the\\ndiscretion of the court?\\n\\nAttorney Arnon: \"The judges have no choice but to trust the\\npresentations made to them. The judges do not have the tools to\\ninvestigate.  This gives the government enormous power, power which\\nthey can misuse.\"\\n\\n-- And what if there really is a security issue?\\n\\nAttorney Arnon: \"I am a man of the legal system, not a security expert.\\n Democracy stands in opposition to security.  I believe it is possible\\nto publicize the matter of the arrest and the charges -- without\\nentering into detail.  We have already seen how the laws concerning\\npublication bans can be misused, in the case of the Rachel Heller\\nmurder.  A suspect in the murder was held for many months without the\\nmatter being made public.\"\\n\\nAttorney Shiffman, on the other hand, believes that state security can\\nbe a legitimate reason for prohibiting publication of a suspect\\'s\\narrest, or of a convicted criminal\\'s imprisonment.  \"A healthy\\nsituation?  Definitely not.  But I am aware of the fact that mere\\npublication may be harmful to state security\".\\n\\nA different opinion is expressed by attorney Uri Shtendal, former\\nadvisor for Arab affairs to Prime Ministers Levi Eshkol and Golda\\nMeir.  \"Clearly, we are speaking of isolated special cases.  Such\\nsituations contrast with the principle that a judicial proceeding must\\nbe held in public. No doubt this contradicts the principle of freedom\\nof expression.  Definitely also to the principle of individual freedom\\nwhich is also harmed by the prohibition of publication.\\n\\n\"Nevertheless\", adds Shtendal, \"the legislator allowed for the\\npossibility of such a ban, to accommodate special cases where the\\ndamage possible as a consequence of publication is greater than that\\nwhich may follow from an abridgment of the principles I\\'ve mentioned.\\nThe authority to decide such matters of publication does not rest with\\nthe Prime Minister or the security services, but with the court, which\\nwe may rest assured will authorize a publication ban only if it has\\nbeen convinced of its need beyond a shadow of a doubt.\"\\n\\nNevertheless, attorney Shtendal agrees: \"As a rule, clearly such a\\nphenomenon is undesirable. Such an extreme step must be taken only in\\nthe most extreme circumstances.\"\\n--\\nYigal Arens\\nUSC/ISI                                                TV made me do it!\\narens@isi.edu\\n',\n",

So, what do you think is the \"meaning behind\", \\n\\tthe intention and the effect when an \"army\" purposely \\n\\t*does not were uniforms but goes out of its way to *look \\n\\tlike civilians\\'? *They are judging that the benefit they will \\n\\treceive from this \"cover\" is more important that the harm\\n\\tthat will come to civilians.*\\n\\nThis is a comment on the Israeli experience and is saying\\nthat the guerillas *do* have some responsibility in putting civilians\\nin \"the middle\" of this fight. By putting on uniforms and living apart\\nfrom civilians (barracks, etc.), the guerillas would significantly lower\\nthe risk to civilians.\\n\\n\\tBut if the guerillas do this aren\\'t *they* putting themselves\\n\\tat greater risk? Absolutely, they ask themselves \"why set \\n\\tourselves apart (by wearing uniforms) when there is a ready-made \\n\\tcover for us (civilians)?

I have always thought that Israel\\'s bombing\\nsortees and bombing policy is stupid, thoughtless, inhumane AND\\nineffective. BUT, there is no reason that Israel should passive wait \\nuntil attackers chose to act; there is every reason to believe that\\n\"taking the fight *to* the enemy\" will do more to stop attacks. \\n\\nAs I said previously, Israel spent several decades \"sitting passively\"\\non its side of a border and only acting to stop these attacks *after*\\nthe attackers had entered Israeli territory. It didn\\'t work very well.\\nThe \"host\" Arab state did little/nothing to try and stop these attacks \\nfrom its side of the border with Israel so the number of attacks\\nwere considerably higher, as was their physical and psychological impact \\non the civilians caught in their path.  \\n>\\n>|> What?So the whole bit about attacks on Israel from neighboring Arab states \\n>|> can start all over again?

By your\\ncriteria *everyone* should stay away from the negotiations.\\n\\nThat is precisely why the Palestinians (in their recent PISGA proposal for \\nthe \"interim\" period after negotiations and leading up to full autonomy) are\\ndemanding conditions that essentially define \"autonomy\" already. They DO\\nNOT trust that Israel will \"follow through\" the entire process and allow\\nPalestinians to reach full autonomy. \\n\\nDo you understand and accept this viewpoint by the Palestinians? \\nIf you do, then why should Israel\\'s view of Arabs/Palestinians \\nbe any different? Why should they trust the Arab/Palestinians\\' words?\\nSince they don\\'t, they are VERY reluctant to give up \"tangible assets \\n(land, control of areas) in exchange for \"words\". For this reason,\\nthey are also concerned about the sorts of \"guarantees\" they will have \\nthat the Arabs WILL follow through on their part of any agreement reached.\\n>\\n>But don\\'t you see that the same statement can be made both ways?\\n>If Lebanon was interested in peace then it should accept the word\\n>of Israel that the attacks were the cause for war and disarming the\\n>Hizbollah will remove the cause for its continued occupancy.  \\n\\nAbsolutely, so are the Arabs/Palestinians asking FIRST for the\\nIsraelis \"word\" in relation to any agreement? NO, what is being\\ndemanded FIRST is LAND. When the issue is LAND, and one party\\nfinally gets HOLD of this \"land\", what the \"other party\" does\\nis totally irrelevent.

What \\nwas he killed for. He hadn\\'t hurt anyone, hadn\\'t said any word he oughtn\\'t \\nhave. Why did they kill him? I want to find out--from here, from there, from \\nthe government--why my husband was killed.\\n\\nOn the 27th, when I returned from work--it was a Saturday--my son was at home.\\nHe doesn\\'t work. I went straight to the kitchen, and he called me, \"Mamma, is \\nthere a soccer game?\" There were shouts from Lenin Street. That\\'s where we \\nlived. I say, \"I don\\'t know, Igor, I haven\\'t turned on the TV.\" He looked \\nagain and said, \"Mamma, what\\'s going on in the courtyard?!\" I look and see so \\nmany people, it\\'s awful, marching, marching, there are hundreds, thousands, \\nyou can\\'t even tell how many there are. They\\'re shouting, \"Down with the \\nArmenians! Kill the Armenians! Tear the Armenians to pieces!\" My God, why is \\nthat happening, what for? I had known nothing at that point. We lived together\\nwell, in friendship, and suddenly something like this. It was completely \\nunexpected. And they were shouting, \"Long live Turkey!\" And they had flags,\\nand they were shouting. There was a man walking in front well dressed, he\\'s \\naround 40 or 45, in a gray raincoat. He is walking and saying something, I \\ncan\\'t make it out through the vent window. He is walking and saying something,\\nand the children behind him are shouting, \"Tear the Armenians to pieces!\" and \\n\"Down with the Armenians!\" They shout it again, and then shout, \"Hurrah!\" The \\npeople streamed without end, they were walking in groups, and in the groups I \\nsaw that there were women, too. I say, \"My God, there are women there too!\" \\nAnd my son says, \"Those aren\\'t women, Mamma, those are bad women.\" Well we \\ndidn\\'t look a long time. They were walking and shouting and I was afraid, I \\nsimply couldn\\'t sit still. I went out onto the balcony, and my Azerbaijani \\nneighbor is on the other balcony, and I say, \"Khalida, what\\'s going on, what \\nhappened?\" She says, \"Emma, I don\\'t know, I don\\'t know, I don\\'t know what \\nhappened.\" Well she was quite frightened too. They had these white sticks, \\neach second or third one had a white rod. They\\'re waving the rods above their \\nheads as they walk, and the one who\\'s out front, like a leader, he has a white\\nstick too. Well maybe it was an armature shaft, but what I saw was white, I \\ndon\\'t know.\\n\\nMy husband got home 10 or 15 minutes later. He comes home and I say, \"Oh \\ndear, I\\'m frightened, they\\'re going to kill us I bet.\" And he says, \"What are \\nyou afraid of, they\\'re just children.\" I say, \"Everything that happens comes \\nfrom children.\" There had been 15- and 16-year kids from the Technical and \\nVocational School. \"Don\\'t fear,\" he said, \"it\\'s nothing, nothing all that \\nbad.\" He didn\\'t eat, he just lay on the sofa. And just then on television they\\nbroadcast that two Azerbaijanis had been killed in Karabakh, near Askeran. \\nWhen I heard that I couldn\\'t settle down at all, I kept walking here and \\nthere and I said, \"They\\'re going to kill us, the Azerbaijanis are going to \\nkill us.\" And he says, \"Don\\'t be afraid.\" Then we heard--from the central \\nsquare, there are women shouting near near the stage, well, they\\'re shouting\\ndifferent things, and you couldn\\'t hear every well. I say, \"You speak\\nAzerbaijani well, listen to what they\\'re saying.\" He says \"Close the window\\nand go to bed, there s nothing happening there.\" He listened a bit and then \\nclosed the window and went to bed, and told us, \"Come on, go to sleep, it\\'s\\nnothing.\" Sleep, what did he mean sleep?  My Son and I stood at the window\\nuntil two in the morning watching. Well he\\'s sick, and all of this was\\naffecting him. I say, \"Igor, you go to bed, I\\'m going to go to bed in a minute\\ntoo.\" He went and I sat at the window until three, and then went to bed. \\nThings had calmed down slightly.\\n\\nThe 28th, Sunday, was my day off. My husband got up and said, \"Come on, Emma, \\nget up.\" I say, \"Today\\'s my day off, let me rest.\" He says, \"Aren\\'t you going \\nto make me some tea?\" Well I felt startled and got up, and said, \"Where are \\nyou going?\" He says, \"I\\'m going out, I have to.\" I say, \"Can you really go \\noutside on a day like today? Don\\'t go out, for God\\'s sake. You never listen to\\nme, I know, and you\\'re not going to listen to me now, but at least don\\'t take \\nthe car out of the garage, go without the car.\" And he says, \"Come on, close \\nthe door!\" And then on the staircase he muttered something, I couldn\\'t make it\\nout, he probably said \"coward\" or something.\\n\\nI closed the door and he left. And I started cleaning . . . picking things up\\naround the house . . . Everything seemed quiet until one o\\'clock in the after-\\nnoon, but at the bus station, my neighbor told me, cars were burning. I said,\\n\"Khalida, was it our car?\" She says, \"No, no, Emma, don\\'t be afraid, they\\nwere government cars and Zhigulis.\\'\\' Our car is a GAZ-21 Volga. And I waited,\\nit was four o\\'clock, five o\\'clock . . . and when he wasn\\'t home at seven I\\nsaid, \"Oh, they\\'ve killed Shagen!\"\\n\\nTires are burning in town, there\\'s black smoke in town, and I\\'m afraid, I\\'m \\nstanding on the balcony and I\\'m all . . . my whole body is shaking. My God, \\nthey\\'ve probably killed him! So basically I waited like that until ten \\no\\'clock and he still hadn\\'t come home. And I\\'m afraid to go out. At ten\\no\\'clock I look out: across from our building is a building with a bookstore,\\nand from upstairs, from the second floor, everything is being thrown outside. \\nI\\'m looking out of one window and Igor is looking out of the other, and I \\ndon\\'t want him to see this, and he, as it turns out, doesn\\'t want me to see \\nit. We wanted to hide it from one another. I joined him. \"Mamma,\" he says,\\n\"look what they\\'re doing over there!\" They were burning everything, and there \\nwere police standing there, 10 or 15 of them, maybe twenty policemen standing \\non the side, and the crowd is on the other side, and two or three people are \\nthrowing everything down from the balcony. And one of the ones on the balcony \\nis shouting, \"What are you standing there for, burn it!\" When they threw the \\ntelevision, wow, it was like a bomb! Our neighbor on the third floor came out \\non her balcony and shouted, \"Why are you doing that, why are you burning those\\nthings, those people saved with such difficulty to buy those things for their \\nhome. Why are you burning them?\" And from the courtyard they yell at her, \"Go \\ninside, go inside! Instead why don\\'t you tell us if they are any of them in \\nyour building or not?\" They meant Armenians, but they didn\\'t say Armenians, \\nthey said, \"of them.\" She says, \"No, no, no, none!\" Then she ran downstairs to\\nour place, and says, \"Emma, Emma, you have to leave!\" I say, \"They\\'ve killed\\nShagen anyway, what do we have to live for? It won\\'t be living for me without \\nShagen. Let them kill us, too!\" She insists, saying, \"Emma, get out of here, \\ngo to Khalida\\'s, and give me the key. When they come I\\'ll say that it\\'s my \\ndaughter\\'s apartment, that they\\'re off visiting someone.\" I gave her the key \\nand went to the neighbor\\'s, but I couldn\\'t endure it. I say, \"Igor, you stay \\nhere, I\\'m going to go downstairs, and see, maybe Papa\\'s . . . Papa\\'s there.\"\\n\\nMeanwhile, they were killing the two brothers, Alik and Valery [Albert and \\nValery Avanesians; see the accounts of Rima Avanesian and Alvina Baluian], in \\nthe courtyard. There is a crowd near the building, they\\'re shouting, howling, \\nand I didn\\'t think that they were killing at the time. Alik and Valery lived\\nin the corner house across from ours. When I went out into the courtyard I saw\\nan Azerbaijani, our neighbor, a young man about 30 years old. I say, \"Madar, \\nUncle Shagen\\'s gone, let\\'s go see, maybe he\\'s dead in the garage or near the \\ngarage, let\\'s at least bring the corpse into the house. \"He shouts, \"Aunt \\nEmma, where do you think you\\'re going?! Go back into the house, I\\'ll look for \\nhim.\" I say, \"Something will happen to you, too, because of me, no, Madar, \\nI\\'m coming too.\" Well he wouldn\\'t let me go all the same, he says, \"You stay \\nhere with us, I\\'m go look.\" He went and looked, and came back and said, \"Aunt \\nEmma, there\\'s no one there, the garage is closed. \"Madar went off again and \\nthen returned and said, \"Aunt Emma, they\\'re already killed Alik, and Valery\\'s \\nthere . . . wheezing.\"\\n\\nMadar wanted to go up to him, but those scoundrels said, \"Don\\'t go near him, \\nor we\\'ll put you next to him.\" He got scared--he\\'s young--and came back and \\nsaid, \"I\\'m going to go call, maybe an ambulance will come, at least to take \\nAlik, maybe he\\'ll live . . . \" They grew up together in our courtyard, they \\nknew each other well, they had always been on good terms. He went to call, but\\nnot a single telephone worked, they had all been shut off. He called, and \\ncalled, and called, and called--nothing.\\n\\nI went upstairs to the neighbor\\'s. Igor says, \"Two police cars drove up over \\nthere, their headlights are on, but they\\'re not touching them, they are still \\nlying where they were, they\\'re still lying there . . . \"We watched out the\\nwindow until four o\\'clock, and then went downstairs to our apartment. I didn\\'t\\ntake my clothes off. I lay on the couch so as not to go to bed, and at six\\no\\'clock in the morning I got up and said, \"Igor, you stay here at home, don\\'t\\ngo out, don\\'t go anywhere, I\\'m going to look, I have to find Papa, dead or\\nalive . . . let me go . . . I\\'ve got the keys from work.\"\\n\\nAt six o\\'clock I went to the Emergency Hospital. The head doctor and another \\ndoctor opened the door to the morgue. I run up to them and say, \"Doctor, is \\nShagen there?\" He says, \"What do you mean? Why should Shagen be here?!\" I \\nwanted to go in, but he wouldn\\'t let me. There were only four people in there,\\nthey said. Well, they must have been awful because they didn\\'t let me in. They\\nsaid, \"Shagen\\'s not here, he\\'s alive somewhere, he\\'ll come back.\"\\n\\nIt\\'s already seven o\\'clock in the morning. I look and there is a panel truck\\nwith three policemen. Some of our people from the hospital were there with\\nthem. I say, \"Sara Baji [\"Sister\" Sara, term of endearment], go look, they\\'ve\\nprobably brought Shagen.\" I said it, shouted it, and she went and came back\\nand says, \"No, Emma, he has tan shoes on, it\\'s a younger person.\" Now Shagen \\njust happened to have tan shoes, light tan, they were already old. When they \\nsaid it like that I guessed immediately. I went and said, \"Doctor, they\\'ve \\nbrought Shagen in dead.\" He says, \"Why are you carrying on like that, dead, \\ndead . . . he\\'s alive.\" But then he went all the same, and when he came back \\nthe look on his face was . . . I could tell immediately that he was dead. They\\nknew one another well, Shagen had worked for him a long time. I say, \"Doctor, \\nis it Shagen?\" He says, \"No, Emma, it\\'s not he, it\\'s somebody else entirely.\" \\nI say, \"Doctor, why are you deceiving me, I\\'ll find out all the same anyway, \\nif not today, then tomorrow.\" And he said . . . I screamed, right there in the\\noffice. He says, \"Emma, go, go calm down a little.\" Another one of our \\ncolleagues said that the doctor had said it was Shagen, but . . . in hideous \\ncondition. They tried to calm me down, saying it wasn\\'t Shagen. A few minutes \\nlater another colleague comes in and says, \"Oh, poor Emma!\" When she said it \\nlike that there was no hope left.\\n\\n   That day was awful. They were endlessly bringing in dead and injured \\npeople.\\n\\nAt night someone took me home. I said, \"Igor, Papa\\'s been killed.\"\\n\\nOn the morning of the 1st I left Igor at home again and went to the hospital: \\nI had to bury him somehow, do something. I look and see that the hospital is \\nsurrounded by soldiers. They are wearing dark clothes. \"Hey, citizen, where \\nare you going?\" I say, \"I work here,\" and from inside someone shouts, \"Yes, \\nyes, that\\'s our cook, let her in.\" I went right to the head doctor\\'s office\\nand there is a person from the City Health Department there, he used to\\nwork with us at the hospital. He says, \"Emma, Shagen\\'s been taken to Baku.\\nIn the night they took the wounded and the dead, all of them, to Baku.\" I\\nsay, \"Doctor, how will I bury him?\" He says, \"We\\'re taking care of all that,\\ndon\\'t you worry, we\\'ll do everything, we\\'ll tell you about it. Where did you\\nspend the night?\" I say, \"I was at home.\" He says, \"What do you mean you\\nwere at home?! You were at home alone?\" I say, \"No, Igor was there too.\" He\\nsays, \"You can\\'t stay home, we\\'re getting an ambulance right now, wait just\\none second, the head doctor is coming, we\\'re arranging an ambulance right\\nnow, you put on a lab coat and take one for Igor, you go and bring Igor here\\nlike a patient, and you\\'ll stay here and we\\'ll se~ later what to do next ...\"\\nHis last name is Kagramanov. The head doctor\\'s name is Izyat Jamalogli\\nSadukhov.\\n\\nThe \"ambulance\" arrived and I went home and got Igor. They admitted him as a \\npatient, they gave us a private room, an isolation room. We stayed in the \\nhospital until the 4th.\\n\\nSome police car came and they said, \"Emma, let\\'s go.\" And the women, our \\ncolleagues, then they saw the police car, became anxious and said, \"Where are \\nyou taking her?\" I say, \"They\\'re going to kill me, too . . . \" And the\\ninvestigator says, \"Why are you saying that, we\\'re going to make a positive\\nidentification.\" We went to Baku and they took me into the morgue . . . I\\nstill can\\'t remember what hospital it was . . . The investigator says, \"Let\\'s \\ngo, we need to be certain, maybe it\\'s not Shagen.\" And when I saw the caskets,\\nlying on top of one another, I went out of my mind. I say, \"I can\\'t look, no.\"\\nThe investigator says, \"Are there any identifying marks?\" I say, \"Let me see\\nthe clothes, or the shoes, or even a sock, I\\'ll recognize them.\" He says, \\n\"Isn\\'t they\\'re anything on his body?\" I say he has seven gold teeth and his \\nfinger, he only has half of one of his fingers. Shagen was a carpenter, he had\\nbeen injured at work . . .\\n\\nThey brought one of the sleeves of the shirt and sweater he was wearing, they \\nbrought them and they were all burned . . . When I saw them I shouted, \"Oh, \\nthey burned him!\" I shouted, I don\\'t know, I fell down . . . or maybe I sat \\ndown, I don\\'t remember. And that investigator says, \"Well fine, fine, since \\nwe\\'ve identified that these are his clothes, and since his teeth . . . since\\nhe has seven gold teeth . . . \"\\n\\nOn the 4th they told me: \"Emma, it\\'s time to bury Shagen now.\" I cried, \"How, \\nhow can I bury Shagen when I have only one son and he\\'s sick? I should inform \\nhis relatives, he has three sisters, I can\\'t do it by myself.\" They say, \"OK, \\nyou know the situation. How will they get here from Karabagh? How will they \\nget here from Yerevan? There\\'s no transportation, it s impossible.\"\\n\\nHe was killed on February 28, and I buried him on March 7. We buried him in \\nSumgait. They asked me, \"Where do you want to bury him?\" I said, \"I want to \\nbury him in Karabagh, where we were born, let me bury him in Karabagh,\" I\\'m \\nshouting, and the head of the burial office, I guess, says, \"Do you know what \\nit means, take him to Karabagh?! It means arson!\" I say, \"What do you mean, \\narson? Don\\'t they know what\\'s going on in Karabagh? The whole world knows that\\nthey killed them, and I want to take him to Karabagh, I don\\'t have anyone \\nanymore.\" I begged, I pleaded, I grieved, I even got down on my knees. He\\nsays, \"Let\\'s bury him here now, and in three months, in six months, a year, \\nif it calms down, I\\'ll help you move him to Karabagh . . . \"\\n\\nOur trial was the first in Sumgait. It was concluded on May 16. At the\\ninvestigation the murderer, Tale Ismailov, told how it all happened, but then\\nat the trial he . . . tried to wriggle . . . he tried to soften his crime. \\nThen they brought a videotape recorder, I guess, and played it, and said, \\n\"Ismailov, look, is that you?\" He says, \"Yes.\" \"Well look, here you\\'re \\ndescribing everything as it was on the scene of the crime, right?\" He says, \\n\"Yes.\" \"And now you\\'re telling it differently?\" He says, \"Well maybe I \\nforgot!\" Like that.\\n\\nThe witnesses and that criminal creep himself said that when the car was going\\nalong Mir Street, there was a crowd of about 80 people . . . Shagen had a \\nVolga GAZ-21. The 80 people surrounded his car, and all 80 of them were \\ninvolved. One of them was this Ismailov guy, this Tale. They--it\\'s unclear\\nwho--started pulling Shagen out of the car. Well, one says from the left side\\nof the car, another says from the right side. They pulled off his sports \\njacket. He had a jacket on. Well they ask him, \"What\\'s your nationality?\" He \\nsays, \"Armenian.\" Well they say from the crowd they shouted, \"If he\\'s an\\nArmenian, kill him, kill him!\" They started beating him, they broke seven of\\nhis ribs, and his heart . . . I don\\'t know, they did something there, too \\n. . . it\\'s too awful to tell about. Anyway, they say this Tale guy . . . he \\nhad an armature shaft. He says, \"I picked it up, it was lying near a bush, \\nthat\\'s where I got it.\" He said he picked it up, but the witnesses say that he\\nhad already had it. He said, \"I hit him twice,\" he said, \" . . . once or twice\\non the head with that rod.\" And he said that when he started to beat him \\nShagen was sitting on the ground, and when he hit him he fell over. He said, \\n\"I left, right nearby they were burning things or something in an apartment,\\nkilling someone,\" he says, \"and I came back to look, is that Shagen alive or\\nnot?\" I said, \"You wanted to finish him, right, and if he was still alive, you\\ncame back to hit him again?\" He went back and looked and he was already dead.\\n\"After that,\" that bastard Tale said, \"after that I went home.\"\\n\\nI said, \"You . . . you . . . little snake,\" I said, \"Are you a thief and a \\nmurderer?\" Shagen had had money in his jacket, and a watch on his wrist. They\\nwere taken. He says he didn\\'t take them\\n\\nWhen they overturned and burned the car, that Tale was no longer there, it was\\nother people who did that. Who it was, who turned over the car and who burned\\nit, that hasn\\'t been clarified as yet. I told the investigator, \"How can you \\nhave the trial when you don\\'t know who burned the car?\" He said something, but\\nI didn\\'t get what he was saying. But I said, \"You still haven\\'t straightened \\neverything out, I think that\\'s unjust.\"\\n\\nWhen they burned the car he was lying next to it, and the fire spread to him. \\nIn the death certificate it says that he had third-degree burns over 80\\npercent of his body . . .\\n\\nAnd I ask again, why was he killed? My husband was a carpenter; he was a good \\ncraftsman, he knew how to do everything, he even fixed his own car, with his \\nown hands. We have three children. Three sons. Only Igor was with me at the \\ntime. The older one was in Pyatigorsk, and the younger one is serving in the \\nArmy. And now they\\'re fatherless...\\n\\nI couldn\\'t sit all the way through it. When the Procurator read up to 15\\nyears\\' deprivation of freedom, I just . . . I went out of my mind, I didn\\'t\\nknow what to do with myself, I said, \"How can that be? You,\" I said, \"you are \\nsaying that it was intentional murder and the sentence is 15 years\\' \\ndeprivation of freedom?\" I screamed, I had my mind! I said, \"Let me at that\\ncreep, with my bare hands I\\'ll . . . \" A relative restrained me, and there\\nwere all those military people there . . . I lest. I said,\" This isn\\'t a \\nSoviet trial, this is unjust!\" That\\'s what I shouted, l said it and left . . .\\n\\nI said that on February 27, when those people were streaming down our street, \\nthey were shouting, \"Long live Turkey!\" and \"Glory to Turkey!\" And during the \\ntrial I said to that Ismailov, \"What does that mean, \\'Glory to Turkey\\'?\" I \\nstill don\\'t understand what Turkey has to do with this, we live in the Soviet \\nUnion. That Turkey told you to or is going to help you kill Armenians? I still\\ndon\\'t understand why \"Glory to Turkey!\" I asked that question twice and got no\\nanswer . . .

If you\\'re feeling\\ncreative, and your favorite number hasn\\'t been taken already, you can\\nmake a request, subject to KotL approval. (Warning, non-numeric, non-\\nbase-10 number requests are likely to earn a flame from the KotL. Not\\nthat you won\\'t get it, but you _will_ pay for it.)\\n\\nOh, and just one little, tiny suggestion. Ask the KotL in e-mail. You\\'ll\\njust be playing the lightning rod for flames if you post to the whole\\nnet, and you\\'ll look like a clueless newbie too.\\n\\nBy now you\\'re probably asking \"So who\\'s the KotL already?\". Well, as\\nJohn Sloan notes below, that\\'s about the only real \"secret\" left around\\nhere, but a few (un)subtle hints can be divulged. First, it is not myself,\\nnor anyone mentioned by name in this posting (maybe :-), though John was\\nthe original KotL. Second, in keeping with the true spirit of Unix, the\\nKotL\\'s first name is only two letters long, and can be spelled entirely\\nwith hexadecimal characters. (2.5, the KotL shares his name with a line-\\noriented text utility.) Third, he has occasionally been seen posting\\nmessages bestowing new DoD numbers (mostly to boneheads with \"weenie\\nmailers\"). Fourth, there is reason to suspect the KotL of being a\\nDead-Head.\\n\\n***************** Newsflash: A message from the KotL ******************\\n\\nOnce you have surmounted this intellectual pinnacle and electronically\\ngroveled to the KotL, please keep in mind that the KotL does indeed\\nwork for a living, and occasionally must pacify its boss by getting\\nsomething done.  Your request may languish in mailer queue for (gasp!)\\ndays, perhaps even (horrors!) a week or two.  During such times of\\neconomic activity on the part of the KotL\\'s employers, sending yet\\nanother copy of your request will not speed processing of the queue (it\\njust makes it longer, verification of this phenominon is left as an\\nexcersize for the reader).  If you suspect mailer problems, at least\\nannotate subsequent requests with an indication that a former request\\nwas submitted, lest you be assigned multiple numbers (what, you think\\nthe KotL *memorizes* the list?!?).\\n\\n***********************************************************************\\n\\nOne more thing, the KotL says that its telepathic powers aren\\'t what\\nthey used to be. So provide some information for the list, will ya?\\nThe typical DoD List entry contains number, name, state/country, &\\ne-mail address. For example:\\n\\n0111:Ed Green:CA:ed.green@East.Sun.COM\\n\\n(PS: While John mentions below that net access and a bike are the only\\nrequirements for DoD membership, that\\'s not strictly true these days, as\\nthere are a number of Denizens who lack one or both.)\\n\\nBlaine (Dances With Bikers) Gardner   blgardne@javelin.sim.es.com\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n            \"Denizens of Doom\", by Bruce Tanner (DoD 0161)\\n\\n      [Road Rider, August 1991, reprinted with Bruce\\'s permission]\\n\\nThere is a group of motorcyclists that gets together and does all the normal \\nthings that a bunch of bikers do.  They discuss motorcycles and  \\nmotorcycling, beverages, cleaning fluids, baklavah, balaclava, caltrops,  \\nhelmets, anti-fog shields, spine protectors, aerodynamics, three-angle valve\\nseats, bird hits, deer whistles, good restaurants, racing philosophy, \\ntraffic laws, tickets, corrosion control, personalities, puns, double \\nentendres, culture, absence of culture, first rides and friendship.  They \\nargue with each other and plan rides together.\\n\\nThe difference between this group and your local motorcycle club is that, \\nalthough they get together just about everyday, most have never seen each \\nother face to face.  The members of this group live all over the known world \\nand communicate with each other electronically via computer.\\n\\nThe computers range from laptops to multi-million dollar computer centers;  \\nthe people range from college and university students to high-tech industry \\nprofessionals to public-access electronic bulletin-board users.  Currently, \\nrec.motorcycles (pronounced \"wreck-dot-motorcycles,\" it\\'s the file name for \\nthe group\\'s primary on-line \"meeting place\") carries about 2250 articles per \\nmonth;  it is read by an estimated 29,000 people.  Most of the frequent \\nposters belong to a motorcycle club, the Denizens of Doom, usually referred \\nto as the DoD.\\n\\nThe DoD started when motorcyclist John R. Nickerson wrote a couple of \\nparodies designed to poke fun at motorcycle stereotypes.  Fellow computer \\nenthusiast Bruce Robinson posted these articles under the pen name, \"Denizen \\nof Doom.\"  A while later Chuck Rogers signed off as DoD nr. 0003 Keeper of \\nthe Flame.  Bruce was then designated DoD nr. 0002, retroactively and, of \\ncourse, Nickerson, the originator of the parodies, was given DoD nr. 0001.\\n\\nThe idea of a motorcycle club with no organization, no meetings and no rules \\nappealed to many, so John Sloan -- DoD nr. 0011 -- became Keeper of the \\nList, issuing DoD numbers to anyone who wanted one.  To date there have been \\nalmost 400 memberships issued to people all over the United States and \\nCanada, as well as Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, France, \\nGermany, Norway and Finland.\\n\\nKeeper of the List Sloan eventually designed a club patch.  The initial run \\nof 300 patches sold out immediately.  The profits from this went to the \\nAmerican Motorcycle Heritage Foundation.  Another AMHF fund raiser -- \\nselling Denizens of Doom pins to members -- was started by Arnie Skurow a \\nfew months later.  Again, the project was successful and the profits were \\ndonated to the foundation.  So far, the Denizens have contributed over $1500 \\nto the AMA museum.  A plaque in the name of the Denizens of Doom now hangs \\nin the Motorcycle Heritage Museum.\\n\\nAs often as possible, the DoD\\'ers crawl out from behind their CRTs and go \\nriding together.  It turns out that the two largest concentrations of \\nDoD\\'ers are centered near Denver/Boulder, Colorado, and in California\\'s \\n\"Silicon Valley.\"  Consequently, two major events are the annual Assault on \\nRollins Pass in Colorado, and the Northern versus Southern California \\n\"Joust.\"\\n\\nThe Ride-and-Feed is a bike trip over Rollins Pass, followed by a big \\nbarbecue dinner.  The concept for the Joust is to have riders from Northern \\nCalifornia ride south; riders from Southern California to ride north, \\nmeeting at a predesignated site somewhere in the middle.  An additional plan \\nfor 1991 is to hold an official Denizens of Doom homecoming in conjunction \\nwith the AMA heritage homecoming in Columbus, Ohio, in July.\\n\\nThough it\\'s a safe bet the the Denizens of Doom and their collective \\ncommunications hub, rec.motorcycles, will not replace the more traditional \\nmotorcycle organizations, for those who prowl the electronic pathways in \\nsearch of two-wheeled camaraderie, it\\'s a great way for kindred spirits to \\nget together.  Long may they flame.\\n\\n\\n\"Live to Flame -- Flame to Live\"\\t[centerbar]\\n\\nThis official motto of the Denizens of Doom refers to the ease with which \\nyou can gratuitously insult someone electronically, when you would not do \\nanything like that face to face.  These insults are known as \"flames\";  \\nissuing them is called \"flaming.\"  Flames often start when a member \\ndisagrees with something another member has posted over the network.  A \\ntypical, sophisticated, intelligent form of calm, reasoned rebuttal would be \\nsomething like:  \"What an incredibly stupid statement, you Spandex-clad \\nposeur!\"  This will guarantee that five other people will reply in defense \\nof the original poster, describing just what they think of you, your riding \\nability and your cat.\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n          _The Denizens of Doom: The Saga Unfolds_\\n\\n                  by John Sloan  DoD #0011\\n\\nPeriodically the question \"What is DoD?\" is raised. This is one of\\nthose questions in the same class as \"Why is the sky blue?\", \"If there\\nis a God, why is there so much suffering in the world?\" and \"Why do\\nwomen inevitably tell you that you\\'re such a nice guy just before they\\ndump you?\", the kinds of questions steeped in mysticism, tradition,\\nand philosophy, questions that have inspired research and discussion\\nby philosophers in locker rooms, motorcycle service bays, and in the\\nhalls of academe for generations. \\n\\nA long, long time ago (in computer time, where anything over a few\\nminutes is an eternity and the halting problem really is a problem) on\\na computer far, far away on the net (topologically speaking; two\\nmachines in the same room in Atlanta might route mail to one another\\nvia a system in Chicago), a chap who wished to remain anonymous (but\\nwho was eventually assigned the DoD membership #1) wrote a satire of\\nthe various personalities and flame wars of rec.motorcycles, and\\nsigned it \"The Denizen of Doom\". Not wishing to identify himself, he\\nasked that stalwart individual who would in the fullness of time\\nbecome DoD #2 to post it for him. DoD #2, not really giving a whit\\nabout what other people thought and generally being a right thinking\\nindividual, did so.  Flaming and other amusements followed. \\n\\nHe who would become the holder of DoD membership #3 thought this was\\nthe funniest thing he\\'d seen in a while (being the sort that is pretty\\neasily amused), so he claimed membership in the Denizens of Doom\\nMotorcycle Club, and started signing his postings with his membership\\nnumber. \\n\\nPerhaps readers of rec.motorcycles were struck with the vision of a\\nmotorcycle club with no dues, no rules, no restrictions as to brand or\\nmake or model or national origin of motorcycle, a club organized\\nelectronically.  It may well be that readers were yearning to become a\\npart of something that would provide them with a greater identity, a\\ngestalt personality, something in which the whole was greater than the\\nsum of its parts.  It could also be that we\\'re all computer nerds who\\nwear black socks and sneakers and pocket protectors, who just happen\\nto also love taking risks on machines with awesome power to weight\\nratios, social outcasts who saw a clique that would finally be open\\nminded enough to accept us as members. \\n\\nIn a clear case of self fulfilling prophesy, The Denizens of Doom\\nMotorcycle Club was born. A club in which the majority of members have\\nnever met one another face to face (and perhaps like it that way), yet\\nfeel that they know one another pretty well (or well enough given some\\nof the electronic personalities in the newsgroup). A club organized\\nand run (in the loosest sense of the word) by volunteers through the\\nnetwork via electronic news and mail, with a membership/mailing list\\n(often used to organize group rides amongst members who live in the\\nsame region), a motto, a logo, a series of photo albums circulating\\naround the country (organized by DoD #9), club patches (organized by\\n#11), and even an MTV-style music video (produced by #47 and\\ndistributed on VHS by #18)! \\n\\nWhere will it end? Who knows? Will the DoD start sanctioning races,\\nplacing limits on the memory and clock rate of the on-board engine\\nmanagement computers? Will the DoD organize poker runs where each\\nparticipant collects a hand of hardware and software reference cards?\\nWill the DoD have a rally in which the attendees demand a terminal\\nroom and at least a 386-sized UNIX system? Only time will tell. \\n\\nThe DoD has no dues, no rules, and no requirements other than net\\naccess and a love for motorcycles. To become a member, one need only\\nask (although we will admit that who you must ask is one of the few\\nreally good club secrets). New members will receive via email a\\nmembership number and the latest copy of the membership list, which\\nincludes name, state, and email address. \\n\\nThe Denizens of Doom Motorcycle Club will live forever (or at least\\nuntil next year when we may decided to change the name). \\n\\n                  Live to Flame - Flame to Live\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n     The DoD daemon as seen on the patches, pins, etc. by\\n\\n\\tChuck Rogers,  car377@druhi.att.com,  DoD #0003\\n \\n\\n                :-(           DoD            )-: \\n               :-(  x    __         __    x   )-:      \\n              :-(  x    / /         \\\\ \\\\    x   )-:     \\n             :-(  x    / / -\\\\-----/- \\\\ \\\\    x   )-:    \\n            :-(  L     | \\\\/  \\\\   /  \\\\/ |     F   )-:   \\n            :-(  I     | /    \\\\ /    \\\\ |     L   )-:   \\n            :-(  V     \\\\/ __   /   __ \\\\/     A   )-:   \\n            :-(  E     / /  \\\\     /  \\\\ \\\\     M   )-:   \\n            :-(        | |   \\\\   /   | |     E   )-:   \\n            :-(  T     | | . | _ | . | |         )-:   \\n            :-(  O     | \\\\___// \\\\\\\\___/ |     T   )-:   \\n            :-(         \\\\     \\\\_/     /      O   )-:   \\n            :-(  F       \\\\___     ___/           )-:   \\n            :-(  L        \\\\ \\\\     / /        L   )-:   \\n            :-(  A         \\\\ vvvvv /         I   )-:   \\n            :-(  M         | (   ) |         V   )-:   \\n            :-(  E         | ^^^^^ |         E   )-:   \\n             :-(  x        \\\\_______/        x   )-:    \\n              :-(  x                       x   )-:     \\n               :-(  x   rec.motorcycles   x   )-:\\n                :-(          USENET          )-:\\n\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n                      The DoD\\n\\n              by the Denizen of Doom    DoD #1\\n \\nWelcome one and all to the flamingest, most wonderfullest newsgroup of\\nall time: wreck.mudder-disciples or is it reak.mudder-disciples?

I mean like I like riding my Yuka-yuka Fudgeo-Jammer\\n     11 but what the heck.  \\n\\nStompin: No way, the BMW is it, complete, that\\'s all man.\\n\\nTerrible: Nahhhh, you\\'re sounding like Heritick Ratatnack!

I love my BMW!\\n\\nTerrible: B.T.???\\n\\nArlow: Burley Thumpison, the greatest all American ride you can own.\\n\\nMuck: Ahhh, look, you\\'re making Terrible gag.\\n\\nTerrible: What does BMW stand for anyway??? \\n\\nMuck, Arlow, High: Beats Me, Wilhelm.\\n\\nTerrible: Actually, my name is Terrible.

And in the words of one Denizen, it intends to remain one.\\n\\nSometime in the far distant past, a hapless newbie asked: \"What does DoD\\nstand for? It\\'s not the Department of Defense is it?\" Naturally, a\\nDenizen who had watched the movie \"Top Gun\" a few times too many rose\\nto the occasion and replied:\\n\\n\"That\\'s classified, we could tell you, but then we\\'d have to kill you.\"\\n\\nAnd the rest is history.\\n\\nA variation on the \"security\" theme is to supply disinformation about\\nwhat DoD stands for. Notable contributions (and contributers, where\\nknown) include:\\n\\nDaughters of Democracy (DoD 23)\\t\\tDoers of Donuts\\nDancers of Despair (DoD 9)\\t\\tDebasers of Daughters\\nDickweeds of Denver\\t\\t\\tDriveway of Death\\nDebauchers of Donuts\\t\\t\\tDumpers of Dirtbikes\\n\\nNote that this is not a comprehensive list, as variations appear to be\\nlimited only by the contents of one\\'s imagination or dictionary file.\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n                     The rec.moto.photo archive\\n\\nFirst a bit of history, this all started with Ilana Stern and Chuck\\nRogers organizing a rec.motorcycles photo album. Many copies were made,\\nand several sets were sent on tours around the world, only to vanish in\\nunknown locations. Then Bruce Tanner decided that it would be appropriate\\nfor an electronic medium to have an electronic photo album. Bruce has not\\nonly provided the disk space and ftp & e-mail access, but he has taken\\nthe time to scan most of the photos that are available from the archive.\\n\\nNot only can you see what all these folks look like, you can also gawk\\nat their motorcycles. A few non-photo files are available from the\\nserver too, they include the DoD membership list, the DoD Yellow Pages,\\nthe general rec.motorcycles FAQ, and this FAQ posting.\\n\\nHere are a couple of excerpts from from messages Bruce posted about how\\nto use the archive.\\n\\n**********************************************************\\n\\nVia ftp:\\n\\ncerritos.edu [130.150.200.21]\\n\\nVia e-mail:\\n\\nThe address is server@cerritos.edu.  The commands are given in the body of the\\nmessage.  The current commands are DIR and SEND, given one per line.  The\\narguments to the commands are VMS style file specifications.  For\\nrec.moto.photo the file spec is [DOD]file.  For example, you can send:\\n\\ndir [dod]\\nsend [dod]bruce_tanner.gif\\nsend [dod]dodframe.ps\\n\\nand you\\'ll get back 5 mail messages; a directory listing, 3 uuencoded parts\\nof bruce_tanner.gif, and the dodframe.ps file in ASCII.\\n\\nOh, wildcards (*) are allowed, but a maximum of 20 mail messages (rounded up to\\nthe next whole file) are send.  A \\'send [dod]*.gif\\' would send 150 files of\\n50K each; not a good idea.\\n-- \\nBruce Tanner        (213) 860-2451 x 596    Tanner@Cerritos.EDU\\nCerritos College    Norwalk, CA             cerritos!tanner\\n\\n**********************************************************\\n\\nA couple of comments: Bruce has put quite a bit of effort into this, so\\nwhy not drop him a note if you find the rec.moto.photo archive useful?\\nSecond, since Bruce has provided the server as a favor, it would be kind\\nof you to access it after normal working hours (California time). \\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n                      Patches? What patches?\\n\\nYou may have heard mention of various DoD trinkets such as patches &\\npins. And your reaction was probably: \"I want!\", or \"That\\'s sick!\", or\\nperhaps \"That\\'s sick! I want!\"\\n\\nWell, there\\'s some good news and some bad news. The good news is that\\nthere\\'s been an amazing variety of DoD-labeled widgets created. The bad\\nnews is that there isn\\'t anywhere you can buy any of them. This isn\\'t\\nbecause of any \"exclusivity\" attempt, but simply because there is no\\n\"DoD store\" that keeps a stock. All of the creations have been done by\\nindividual Denizens out of their own pockets. The typical procedure is\\nsomeone says \"I\\'m thinking of having a DoD frammitz made, they\\'ll cost\\n$xx.xx, with $xx.xx going to the AMA museum. Anyone want one?\" Then\\norders are taken, and a batch of frammitzes large enough to cover the\\npre-paid orders is produced (and quickly consumed). So if you want a\\nDoD doodad, act quickly the next time somebody decides to do one. Or\\nproduce one yourself if you see a void that needs filling, after all\\nthis is anarchy in action.\\n\\nHere\\'s a possibly incomplete list of known DoD merchandise (and\\nperpetrators). Patches (DoD#11), pins (DoD#99), stickers (DoD#99),\\nmotorcycle license plate frames (DoD#216), t-shirts (DoD#99), polo shirts\\n(DoD#122), Zippo lighters (DoD#99) [LtF FtL], belt buckles (DoD#99), and\\npatches (DoD#99) [a second batch was done (and rapidly consumed) by\\npopular demand].\\n\\nAll \"profits\" have been donated to the American Motorcyclist Association\\nMotorcycle Heritage Museum. As of June 1992, over $5500 dollars has been\\ncontributed to the museum fund by the DoD. If you visit the museum,\\nyou\\'ll see a large plaque on the Founders\\' Wall in the name of \"Denizens\\nof Doom, USENET, The World\", complete with a DoD pin.\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nHere\\'s a letter from the AMA to the DoD regarding our contributions.\\n\\n~Newsgroups: rec.motorcycles\\n~From: Arnie Skurow <arnie@magnus.acs.ohio-state.edu>\\n~Subject: A letter from the Motorcycle Heritage Museum\\n~Date: Mon, 13 Apr 1992 11:04:58 GMT\\n\\nI received the following letter from Jim Rogers, director of the Museum,\\nthe other day.\\n\\n\"Dear Arnie and all members of the Denizens of Doom:\\n\\nCongratulations and expressions of gratitude are in order for you and the\\nDenizens of Doom!

       "  'From: frank@marvin.contex.com (Frank Perdicaro)\\nSubject: ST1100 ride\\nKeywords: heavy\\nLines: 95\\n\\nSixteen days I had put off test driving the Honda ST1100.  Finally,\\nthe 17th was a Saturday without much rain.  In fact it cleared up, \\nbecame warm and sunny, and the wind died.  About three weeks ago, I\\ntook a long cool ride on the Hawk down to Cycles! 128 for a test ride.\\nThey had sold, and delivered, the demo ST1100 about fifteen hours\\nbefore I arrived.  And the demo VFR was bike-locked in the showroom --\\nsurrounded by 150 other bikes, and not likely to move soon.\\n\\nToday was different.  There were even more bikes.  50 used dirt bikes,\\n50 used street bikes, 35 cars, and a big tent full of Outlandishly Fat\\nTouring Bikes With Trailers were all squeezed in the parking lot.\\nSome sort of fat bike convention.  Shelly and Dave were running one\\nMSF course each, at the same time.  One in the classroom and one on\\nthe back lot.  Plus, there was the usuall free cookout food that\\nCycles! gives away every weekend in the summer.  Hmmm, it seemed like\\na big moto party.\\n\\nAfter about ten minutes of looking for Rob C, cheif of sales slime,\\nand another 5 minutes reading and signing a long disclosure/libility/\\npray-to-god form I helped JT push the ST out into the mess in the\\nparking lot.  We went over the the controls, I put the tank bag from \\nthe Hawk into the right saddlebag, and my wife put everything else\\ninto the left saddlebag.  ( Thats nice.... )  Having helped push the \\nST out to the lot, I thought it best to have JT move it to the edge of\\nthe road, away from the 100+ bikes and 100+ people.  He rode it like a\\nbicycle!  \\'It cant be that heavy\\' I thought.\\n\\nWell I was wrong.  As I sat on the ST, both feet down, all I could \\nthink was \"big\".  Then I put one foot up.  \"Heavy\" came to mind very\\nquickly.  With Cindy on the back -- was she on the back?  Hard to \\ntell with seat three times as large as a Hawk seat -- the bike seemed\\nnearly out of control just idling on the side of the road.\\n\\nBy 3000 rpm in second gear, all the weight seemed to dissappear.  Even\\non bike with 4.1 miles on the odometer, slippery new tires, and pads that \\ndid not yet bite the disks, things seems smooth and sure.  Cycles! is\\non a section of 128 that few folks ever ride.  About 30 miles north\\nof the computer concentration, about five miles north of where I95\\nsplits away, 128 is a lighly travelled, two lane limited access\\nhighway.  It goes through heavily forested sections of Hamilton, \\nManchester-by-the-Sea and Newbury on its way to Gloucester.\\nOn its way there, it meets 133, a road that winds from the sea about\\n30 miles inland to Andover.  On its way it goes through many\\nthoroughly New England spots.  Perfect, if slow, sport touring sections.\\n\\nCindy has no difficulty with speed.  3rd gear, 4th gear, purring along\\nin top gear.  This thing has less low rpm grunt that my Hawk.  Lane \\nchanges were a new experience.  A big heft is required to move this \\nthing.  Responds well though.   No wallowing or complaint.  Behind the\\nfairing it was fairly quiet, but the helmet buffeting was\\nnon-trivial.  Top gear car passing at 85mph was nearly effortless.\\nSmooth, smooth, smooth.   Not sure what the v4 sound reminds me of,\\nbut it is pleasant.  If only the bars were not transmitting an endless\\nbuzz.\\n\\nThe jump on to 133 caused me to be less than impressed with the\\nbrakes.  Its a down hill, reversing camber, twice-reversing radius,\\ndecreasing radius turn.  A real squeeze is needed on the front binder.  \\nThe section of 133 we were on was tight, but too urban.  The ST works ok\\nin this section, but it shows its weight.  We went by the clam shack\\noft featured in \"Spencer for Hire\" -- a place where you could really \\nfind \"Spencer\", his house was about 15 miles down 133.  After putting\\nthrough traffic for a while, we turned and went back to 128.\\n\\nAbout half way through the onramp, I yanked Cindy\\'s wrist, our singal\\nfor \"hold on tight\".  Head check left,  time to find redline.  Second\\ngear gives a good shove.  Third too.  Fourth sees DoD speed with a \\nshort shift into top.  On the way to 133 we saw no cops and very light\\ntraffic.  Did not cross into DoD zone because the bike was too new.\\nWell, now it had 25 miles on it, so it was ok.  Tried some high effort\\nlane changes, some wide sweeping turns.  Time to wick it up?  I went \\nuntil the buffeting was threating to pull us off the seat.  And stayed\\nthere.  When I was comfortable with the wind and the steering, \\nI looked down to find an indicated 135mph.  Not bad for 2-up touring.\\n\\nBeverly comes fast at more than twice the posted limit.  At the \"get\\noff in a mile\" sign, I rolled off the throttle and coasted.  I wanted\\nto re-adjust to the coming slowness.  It was a good idea:  there were\\nseveral manhole-sized patches of sand on the exit ramp.  Back to the \\nslow and heavy behavior.  Cycles! is about a mile from 128.  I could \\nsee even more cars stacked up outside right when I got off.  I managed\\nto thread the ST through the cars to the edge of the concrete pad\\nout front.  Heavy.  It took way too much effort for Cindy and I to put\\nthe thing on the center stand.  I am sure that if I used the side\\nstand the ST would have been on its side within a minute.\\n\\n\\nMy demo opinion?  Heavy.  Put it on a diet.  Smooth, comfortable,\\nhardly notices the DoD speed.   I\\'d buy on for about $3000 less than \\nlist, just like it is.  Too much $ for the bike as it is.\\n-- \\n\\t Frank Evan Perdicaro \\t\\t\\t\\tXyvision Color Systems\\n      Legalize guns, drugs and cash...today.\\t\\t101 Edgewater Drive\\n   inhouse: frank@marvin, x5572\\t\\t\\t\\tWakefield MA\\nouthouse: frank@contex.com, 617-245-4100x5572\\t\\t018801285\\n',\n",

I argued this thoroughly about 3-4 weeks ago.  Men and women are\\ndifferent ... physically, physiologically, and psychologically.  Much\\nrecent evidence for this statement is present in the book \"Brainsex\" by\\nAnne Moir and David Jessel.  I recommend you find a copy and read it.\\nTheir book is an overview of recent scientific research on this topic\\nand is well referenced. \\n\\nNow, if women and men are different in some ways, the law can only\\nadequately take into account their needs in these areas where they are\\ndifferent by also taking into account the ways in which men and women\\nare different.  Maternity leave is an example of this -- it takes into\\naccount that women get pregnant.  It does not give women the same rules\\nit would give to men, because to treat women like it treats men in this\\ninstance would be unjust.  This is just simply an obvious example of\\nwhere men and women are intrinsically different!!!!!\\n\\nNow, people make the _naive_ argument that sexism = oppression.\\nHowever, maternity leave is sexist because MEN DO NOT GET PREGNANT. \\nMen do not have the same access to leave that women do (not to the same\\nextent or degree), and therefore IT IS SEXIST.  No matter however much a\\nman _wants_ to get pregnant and have maternity leave, HE NEVER CAN.  And\\ntherefore the law IS SEXIST.  No man can have access to maternity leave,\\nNO MATTER HOW HARD HE TRIES TO GET PREGNANT.  I hope this is clear.\\n\\nMaternity leave is an example where a sexist law is just, because the\\nsexism here just reflects the \"sexism\" of nature in making men and women\\ndifferent.  There are many other differences between men and women which\\nare far more subtle than pregnancy, and to find out more of these I\\nrecommend you have a look at the book \"Brainsex\".\\n\\nYour point that perhaps some day men can also be pregnant is fallacious.\\nIf men can one day become pregnant it will be by having biologically\\nbecome women!  To have a womb and the other factors required for\\npregnancy is usually wrapped up in the definition of what a woman is --\\nso your argument, when it is examined, is seen to be fallacious.  You\\nare saying that men can have the sexist maternity leave privilege that \\nwomen can have if they also become women -- which actually just supports\\nmy statement that maternity leave is sexist.\\n\\n>The discrimination comes in when a woman is denied opportunities\\n>because of her (legally determined) sexual inferiorities.  As I\\n>understand most religious sexual discrimination, and I doubt that\\n>Islam is exceptional, the female is not allowed into the priestly\\n>caste and in general is subjugated so that she has no aspirations to\\n>rights which, as an equal human, she ought to be entitled to.\\n\\nThere is no official priesthood in Islam -- much of this function is\\ntaken by Islamic scholars.  There are female Islamic scholars and\\nfemale Islamic scholars have always existed in Islam.  An example from\\nearly Islamic history is the Prophet\\'s widow, Aisha, who was recognized\\nin her time and is recognized in our time as an Islamic scholar.\\n\\n>No matter how sweetly you coat it, part of the role of religions\\n>seems, historically, to have served the function of oppressing the\\n>female, whether by forcing her to procreate to the extent where\\n>there is no opportunity for self-improvement, or by denying her\\n>access to the same facilities the males are offered.\\n\\nYou have no evidence for your blanket statement about all religions, and\\nI dispute it.

But they have been systematically \\n          IGNORING or SUPPRESSING an excellent one for 30 years! \\n\\n               The late Physicist Dewey B. Larson\\'s comprehensive \\n          GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, which he \\n          calls the \"Reciprocal System\", is built on two fundamental \\n          postulates about the physical and mathematical natures of \\n          space and time: \\n    \\n               (1) \"The physical universe is composed ENTIRELY of ONE \\n          component, MOTION, existing in THREE dimensions, in DISCRETE \\n          UNITS, and in two RECIPROCAL forms, SPACE and TIME.\" \\n    \\n               (2) \"The physical universe conforms to the relations of \\n          ORDINARY COMMUTATIVE mathematics, its magnitudes are \\n          ABSOLUTE, and its geometry is EUCLIDEAN.\" \\n    \\n               From these two postulates, Larson developed a COMPLETE \\n          Theoretical Universe, using various combinations of \\n          translational, vibrational, rotational, and vibrational-\\n          rotational MOTIONS, the concepts of IN-ward and OUT-ward \\n          SCALAR MOTIONS, and speeds in relation to the Speed of Light \\n          (which Larson called \"UNIT VELOCITY\" and \"THE NATURAL \\n          DATUM\"). \\n      \\n               At each step in the development, Larson was able to \\n          MATCH objects in his Theoretical Universe with objects in the \\n          REAL physical universe, (photons, sub-atomic particles \\n          [INCOMPLETE ATOMS], charges, atoms, molecules, globular star \\n          clusters, galaxies, binary star systems, solar systems, white \\n          dwarf stars, pulsars, quasars, ETC.), even objects NOT YET \\n          DISCOVERED THEN (such as EXPLODING GALAXIES, and GAMMA-RAY \\n          BURSTS). \\n          \\n               And applying his Theory to his NEW model of the atom, \\n          Larson was able to precisely and accurately CALCULATE inter-\\n          atomic distances in crystals and molecules, compressibility \\n          and thermal expansion of solids, and other properties of \\n          matter. \\n\\n               All of this is described in good detail, with-OUT fancy \\n          complex mathematics, in his books. \\n    \\n\\n\\n          BOOKS of Dewey B.

Atkin Ave., Salt Lake City, Utah  84106.  This is the \\n          organization that was started to promote Larson\\'s Theory.  \\n          They have other related publications, including the quarterly \\n          journal \"RECIPROCITY\". \\n\\n          \\n\\n          Physicist Dewey B. Larson\\'s Background\\n    \\n               Physicist Dewey B. Larson was a retired Engineer \\n          (Chemical or Electrical).  He was about 91 years old when he \\n          died in May 1989.  He had a Bachelor of Science Degree in \\n          Engineering Science from Oregon State University.  He \\n          developed his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the \\n          physical universe while trying to develop a way to COMPUTE \\n          chemical properties based only on the elements used. \\n    \\n               Larson\\'s lack of a fancy \"PH.D.\" degree might be one \\n          reason that orthodox physicists are ignoring him, but it is \\n          NOT A VALID REASON.  Sometimes it takes a relative outsider \\n          to CLEARLY SEE THE FOREST THROUGH THE TREES.  At the same \\n          time, it is clear from his books that he also knew ORTHODOX \\n          physics and astronomy as well as ANY physicist or astronomer, \\n          well enough to point out all their CONTRADICTIONS, AD HOC \\n          ASSUMPTIONS, PRINCIPLES OF IMPOTENCE, IN-CONSISTENCIES, ETC.. \\n     \\n               Larson did NOT have the funds, etc. to experimentally \\n          test his Theory.  And it was NOT necessary for him to do so.  \\n          He simply compared the various parts of his Theory with OTHER \\n          researchers\\' experimental and observational data.  And in \\n          many cases, HIS explanation FIT BETTER. \\n    \\n               A SELF-CONSISTENT Theory is MUCH MORE than the ORTHODOX \\n          physicists and astronomers have!  They CLAIM to be looking \\n          for a \"unified field theory\" that works, but have been \\n          IGNORING one for over 30 years now! \\n    \\n               \"Modern physics\" does NOT explain the physical universe \\n          so well.  Some parts of some of Larson\\'s books are FULL of \\n          quotations of leading orthodox physicists and astronomers who \\n          agree.  And remember that \"epicycles\", \"crystal spheres\", \\n          \"geocentricity\", \"flat earth theory\", etc., ALSO once SEEMED \\n          to explain it well, but were later proved CONCEPTUALLY WRONG. \\n    \\n    \\n               Prof. Frank H. Meyer, Professor Emeritus of UW-Superior, \\n          was/is a STRONG PROPONENT of Larson\\'s Theory, and was (or \\n          still is) President of Larson\\'s organization, \"THE \\n          INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY OF UNIFIED SCIENCE\", and Editor of \\n          their quarterly Journal \"RECIPROCITY\".  He moved to \\n          Minneapolis after retiring. \\n    \\n\\n\\n          \"Super Collider\" BOONDOGGLE!\\n          \\n               I am AGAINST contruction of the \"Superconducting Super \\n          Collider\", in Texas or anywhere else.  It would be a GROSS \\n          WASTE of money, and contribute almost NOTHING of \"scientific\" \\n          value. \\n    \\n               Most physicists don\\'t realize it, but, according to the \\n          comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the late Physicist \\n          Dewey B. Larson, as described in his books, the strange GOOFY \\n          particles (\"mesons\", \"hyperons\", ALLEGED \"quarks\", etc.) \\n          which they are finding in EXISTING colliders (Fermi Lab, \\n          Cern, etc.) are really just ATOMS of ANTI-MATTER, which are \\n          CREATED by the high-energy colliding beams, and which quickly \\n          disintegrate like cosmic rays because they are incompatible \\n          with their environment. \\n    \\n               A larger and more expensive collider will ONLY create a \\n          few more elements of anti-matter that the physicists have not \\n          seen there before, and the physicists will be EVEN MORE \\n          CONFUSED THAN THEY ARE NOW! \\n    \\n               Are a few more types of anti-matter atoms worth the $8.3 \\n          BILLION cost?!!  Don\\'t we have much more important uses for \\n          this WASTED money?! \\n    \\n     \\n               Another thing to consider is that the primary proposed \\n          location in Texas has a serious and growing problem with some \\n          kind of \"fire ants\" eating the insulation off underground \\n          cables.  How much POISONING of the ground and ground water \\n          with insecticides will be required to keep the ants out of \\n          the \"Supercollider\"?! \\n    \\n          \\n               Naming the \"Super Collider\" after Ronald Reagon, as \\n          proposed, is TOTALLY ABSURD!  If it is built, it should be \\n          named after a leading particle PHYSICIST. \\n      \\n\\n\\n          LARSONIAN Anti-Matter\\n          \\n               In Larson\\'s comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the \\n          physical universe, anti-matter is NOT a simple case of \\n          opposite charges of the same types of particles.  It has more \\n          to do with the rates of vibrations and rotations of the \\n          photons of which they are made, in relation to the \\n          vibrational and rotational equivalents of the speed of light, \\n          which Larson calls \"Unit Velocity\" and the \"Natural Datum\". \\n     \\n               In Larson\\'s Theory, a positron is actually a particle of \\n          MATTER, NOT anti-matter.  When a positron and electron meet, \\n          the rotational vibrations (charges) and rotations of their \\n          respective photons (of which they are made) neutralize each \\n          other. \\n      \\n               In Larson\\'s Theory, the ANTI-MATTER half of the physical \\n          universe has THREE dimensions of TIME, and ONLY ONE dimension \\n          of space, and exists in a RECIPROCAL RELATIONSHIP to our \\n          MATERIAL half. \\n       \\n\\n\\n          LARSONIAN Relativity\\n          \\n               The perihelion point in the orbit of the planet Mercury \\n          has been observed and precisely measured to ADVANCE at the \\n          rate of 574 seconds of arc per century.  531 seconds of this \\n          advance are attributed via calculations to gravitational \\n          perturbations from the other planets (Venus, Earth, Jupiter, \\n          etc.).  The remaining 43 seconds of arc are being used to \\n          help \"prove\" Einstein\\'s \"General Theory of Relativity\". \\n    \\n               But the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson achieved results \\n          CLOSER to the 43 seconds than \"General Relativity\" can, by \\n          INSTEAD using \"SPECIAL Relativity\".  In one or more of his \\n          books, he applied the LORENTZ TRANSFORMATION on the HIGH \\n          ORBITAL SPEED of Mercury. \\n    \\n               Larson TOTALLY REJECTED \"General Relativity\" as another \\n          MATHEMATICAL FANTASY.  He also REJECTED most of \"Special \\n          Relativity\", including the parts about \"mass increases\" near \\n          the speed of light, and the use of the Lorentz Transform on \\n          doppler shifts, (Those quasars with red-shifts greater than \\n          1.000 REALLY ARE MOVING FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT, \\n          although most of that motion is away from us IN TIME.). \\n     \\n               In Larson\\'s comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the \\n          physical universe, there are THREE dimensions of time instead \\n          of only one.  But two of those dimensions can NOT be measured \\n          from our material half of the physical universe.  The one \\n          dimension that we CAN measure is the CLOCK time.  At low \\n          relative speeds, the values of the other two dimensions are \\n          NEGLIGIBLE; but at high speeds, they become significant, and \\n          the Lorentz Transformation must be used as a FUDGE FACTOR. \\n          [Larson often used the term \"COORDINATE TIME\" when writing \\n          about this.] \\n    \\n     \\n               In regard to \"mass increases\", it has been PROVEN in \\n          atomic accelerators that acceleration drops toward zero near \\n          the speed of light.  But the formula for acceleration is \\n          ACCELERATION = FORCE / MASS, (a = F/m).  Orthodox physicists \\n          are IGNORING the THIRD FACTOR: FORCE.  In Larson\\'s Theory, \\n          mass STAYS CONSTANT and FORCE drops toward zero.  FORCE is \\n          actually a MOTION, or COMBINATIONS of MOTIONS, or RELATIONS \\n          BETWEEN MOTIONS, including INward and OUTward SCALAR MOTIONS.  \\n          The expansion of the universe, for example, is an OUTward \\n          SCALAR motion inherent in the universe and NOT a result of \\n          the so-called \"Big Bang\" (which is yet another MATHEMATICAL \\n          FANTASY). \\n    \\n                                    \\n          \\n          THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\\n\\n               I wish to recommend to EVERYONE the book \"THE UNIVERSE \\n          OF MOTION\", by Dewey B.

Box 13255, Portland, Oregon  97213), 456 \\n          pages, indexed, hardcover. \\n    \\n               It contains the Astrophysical portions of a GENERAL \\n          UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe developed by that \\n          author, an UNrecognized GENIUS, more than thirty years ago. \\n    \\n               It contains FINAL SOLUTIONS to most ALL Astrophysical \\n          mysteries, including the FORMATION of galaxies, binary and \\n          multiple star systems, and solar systems, the TRUE ORIGIN of \\n          the \"3-degree\" background radiation, cosmic rays, and gamma-\\n          ray bursts, and the TRUE NATURE of quasars, pulsars, white \\n          dwarfs, exploding galaxies, etc.. \\n    \\n               It contains what astronomers and astrophysicists are ALL \\n          looking for, if they are ready to seriously consider it with \\n          OPEN MINDS! \\n    \\n               The following is an example of his Theory\\'s success: \\n          In his first book in 1959, \"THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL \\n          UNIVERSE\", Larson predicted the existence of EXPLODING \\n          GALAXIES, several years BEFORE astronomers started finding \\n          them.  They are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of Larson\\'s \\n          comprehensive Theory.  And when QUASARS were discovered, he \\n          had an immediate related explanation for them also. \\n    \\n\\n \\n          GAMMA-RAY BURSTS\\n\\n               Astro-physicists and astronomers are still scratching \\n          their heads about the mysterious GAMMA-RAY BURSTS.  They were \\n          originally thought to originate from \"neutron stars\" in the \\n          disc of our galaxy.  But the new Gamma Ray Telescope now in \\n          Earth orbit has been detecting them in all directions \\n          uniformly, and their source locations in space do NOT \\n          correspond to any known objects, (except for a few cases of \\n          directional coincidence). \\n    \\n               Gamma-ray bursts are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of the \\n          GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe developed by \\n          the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson.  According to page 386 of \\n          his book \"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\", published in 1984, the \\n          gamma-ray bursts are coming from SUPERNOVA EXPLOSIONS in the \\n          ANTI-MATTER HALF of the physical universe, which Larson calls \\n          the \"Cosmic Sector\".  Because of the relationship between the \\n          anti-matter and material halves of the physical universe, and \\n          the way they are connected together, the gamma-ray bursts can \\n          pop into our material half anywhere in space, seemingly at \\n          random.  (This is WHY the source locations of the bursts do \\n          not correspond with known objects, and come from all \\n          directions uniformly.) \\n    \\n               I wonder how close to us in space a source location \\n          would have to be for a gamma-ray burst to kill all or most \\n          life on Earth!  There would be NO WAY to predict one, NOR to \\n          stop it! \\n    \\n               Perhaps some of the MASS EXTINCTIONS of the past, which \\n          are now being blamed on impacts of comets and asteroids, were \\n          actually caused by nearby GAMMA-RAY BURSTS! \\n    \\n\\n\\n          LARSONIAN Binary Star Formation\\n          \\n               About half of all the stars in the galaxy in the \\n          vicinity of the sun are binary or double.  But orthodox \\n          astronomers and astrophysicists still have no satisfactory \\n          theory about how they form or why there are so many of them. \\n    \\n               But binary star systems are actually a LIKELY \\n          CONSEQUENCE of the comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of \\n          the physical universe developed by the late Physicist Dewey \\n          B. Larson. \\n    \\n               I will try to summarize Larsons explanation, which is \\n          detailed in Chapter 7 of his book \"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\" \\n          and in some of his other books. \\n    \\n               First of all, according to Larson, stars do NOT generate \\n          energy by \"fusion\".  A small fraction comes from slow \\n          gravitational collapse.  The rest results from the COMPLETE \\n          ANNIHILATION of HEAVY elements (heavier than IRON).  Each \\n          element has a DESTRUCTIVE TEMPERATURE LIMIT.  The heavier the \\n          element is, the lower is this limit.  A star\\'s internal \\n          temperature increases as it grows in mass via accretion and \\n          absorption of the decay products of cosmic rays, gradually \\n          reaching the destructive temperature limit of lighter and \\n          lighter elements. \\n    \\n               When the internal temperature of the star reaches the \\n          destructive temperature limit of IRON, there is a Type I \\n          SUPERNOVA EXPLOSION!  This is because there is SO MUCH iron \\n          present; and that is related to the structure of iron atoms \\n          and the atom building process, which Larson explains in some \\n          of his books [better than I can]. \\n    \\n               When the star explodes, the lighter material on the \\n          outer portion of the star is blown outward in space at less \\n          than the speed of light.  The heavier material in the center \\n          portion of the star was already bouncing around at close to \\n          the speed of light, because of the high temperature.  The \\n          explosion pushes that material OVER the speed of light, and \\n          it expands OUTWARD IN TIME, which is equivalent to INWARD IN \\n          SPACE, and it often actually DISAPPEARS for a while. \\n    \\n               Over long periods of time, both masses start to fall \\n          back gravitationally.  The material that had been blown \\n          outward in space now starts to form a RED GIANT star.  The \\n          material that had been blown OUTWARD IN TIME starts to form a \\n          WHITE DWARF star.  BOTH stars then start moving back toward \\n          the \"MAIN SEQUENCE\" from opposite directions on the H-R \\n          Diagram. \\n    \\n               The chances of the two masses falling back into the \\n          exact same location in space, making a single lone star \\n          again, are near zero.  They will instead form a BINARY \\n          system, orbiting each other. \\n     \\n               According to Larson, a white dwarf star has an INVERSE \\n          DENSITY GRADIENT (is densest at its SURFACE), because the \\n          material at its center is most widely dispersed (blown \\n          outward) in time.   This ELIMINATES the need to resort to \\n          MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES about \"degenerate matter\", \"neutron \\n          stars\", \"black holes\", etc.. \\n    \\n\\n\\n          LARSONIAN Solar System Formation\\n\\n               If the mass of the heavy material at the center of the \\n          exploding star is relatively SMALL, then, instead of a single \\n          white dwarf star, there will be SEVERAL \"mini\" white dwarf \\n          stars (revolving around the red giant star, but probably \\n          still too far away in three-dimensional TIME to be affected \\n          by its heat, etc.).  These will become PLANETS! \\n      \\n               In Chapter 7 of THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION, Larson used all \\n          this information, and other principles of his comprehensive \\n          GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, to derive \\n          his own version of Bode\\'s Law. \\n          \\n\\n\\n          \"Black Hole\" FANTASY!\\n\\n               I heard that physicist Stephen W. Hawking recently \\n          completed a theoretical mathematical analysis of TWO \"black \\n          holes\" merging together into a SINGLE \"black hole\", and \\n          concluded that the new \"black hole\" would have MORE MASS than \\n          the sum of the two original \"black holes\". \\n    \\n               Such a result should be recognized by EVERYone as a RED \\n          FLAG, causing widespread DOUBT about the whole IDEA of \"black \\n          holes\", etc.! \\n    \\n               After reading Physicist Dewey B. Larson\\'s books about \\n          his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical \\n          universe, especially his book \"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\", it is \\n          clear to me that \"black holes\" are NOTHING more than \\n          MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES!  The strange object at Cygnus X-1 is \\n          just an unusually massive WHITE DWARF STAR, NOT the \"black \\n          hole\" that orthodox astronomers and physicists so badly want \\n          to \"prove\" their theory. \\n    \\n    \\n               By the way, I do NOT understand why so much publicity is \\n          being given to physicist Stephen Hawking.  The physicists and \\n          astronomers seem to be acting as if Hawking\\'s severe physical \\n          problem somehow makes him \"wiser\".  It does NOT! \\n    \\n               I wish the same attention had been given to Physicist \\n          Dewey B. Larson while he was still alive.  Widespread \\n          publicity and attention should NOW be given to Larson\\'s \\n          Theory, books, and organization (The International Society of \\n          Unified Science). \\n          \\n          \\n          \\n          ELECTRO-MAGNETIC PROPULSION\\n\\n               I heard of that concept many years ago, in connection \\n          with UFO\\'s and unorthodox inventors, but I never was able to \\n          find out how or why they work, or how they are constructed. \\n    \\n               I found a possible clue about why they might work on \\n          pages 112-113 of the book \"BASIC PROPERTIES OF MATTER\", by \\n          the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson, which describes part of \\n          Larson\\'s comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical \\n          universe.  I quote one paragraph: \\n    \\n               \"As indicated in the preceding chapter, the development \\n          of the theory of the universe of motion arrives at a totally \\n          different concept of the nature of electrical resistance.  \\n          The electrons, we find, are derived from the environment.  It \\n          was brought out in Volume I [Larson\\'s book \"NOTHING BUT \\n          MOTION\"] that there are physical processes in operation which \\n          produce electrons in substantial quantities, and that, \\n          although the motions that constitute these electrons are, in \\n          many cases, absorbed by atomic structures, the opportunities \\n          for utilizing this type of motion in such structures are \\n          limited.  It follows that there is always a large excess of \\n          free electrons in the material sector [material half] of the \\n          universe, most of which are uncharged.  In this uncharged \\n          state the electrons cannot move with respect to extension \\n          space, because they are inherently rotating units of space, \\n          and the relation of space to space is not motion.  In open \\n          space, therefore, each uncharged electron remains permanently \\n          in the same location with respect to the natural reference \\n          system, in the manner of a photon.  In the context of the \\n          stationary spatial reference system the uncharged electron, \\n          like the photon, is carried outward at the speed of light by \\n          the progression of the natural reference system.  All \\n          material aggregates are thus exposed to a flux of electrons \\n          similar to the continual bombardment by photons of radiation.  \\n          Meanwhile there are other processes, to be discussed later, \\n          whereby electrons are returned to the environment.  The \\n          electron population of a material aggregate such as the earth \\n          therefore stabilizes at an equilibrium level.\" \\n          \\n               Note that in Larson\\'s Theory, UNcharged electrons are \\n          also massLESS, and are basically photons of light of a \\n          particular frequency (above the \"unit\" frequency) spinning \\n          around one axis at a particular rate (below the \"unit\" rate).  \\n          (\"Unit velocity\" is the speed of light, and there are \\n          vibrational and rotational equivalents to the speed of light, \\n          according to Larson\\'s Theory.)  [I might have the \"above\" and \\n          \"below\" labels mixed up.] \\n    \\n               Larson is saying that outer space is filled with mass-\\n          LESS UN-charged electrons flying around at the speed of \\n          light! \\n    \\n               If this is true, then the ELECTRO-MAGNETIC PROPULSION \\n          fields of spacecraft might be able to interact with these \\n          electrons, or other particles in space, perhaps GIVING them a \\n          charge (and mass) and shooting them toward the rear to \\n          achieve propulsion. (In Larson\\'s Theory, an electrical charge \\n          is a one-dimensional rotational vibration of a particular \\n          frequency (above the \"unit\" frequency) superimposed on the \\n          rotation of the particle.) \\n      \\n               The paragraph quoted above might also give a clue to \\n          confused meteorologists about how and why lightning is \\n          generated in clouds. \\n\\n\\n\\n          SUPPRESSION of LARSONIAN Physics\\n\\n               The comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical \\n          universe developed by the late Physicist Dewey B.

Our agency started to express interest in\\n|> virtual reality(VR).  So far, we do not know much about VR.  All we\\n|> know about are the Hollywood movies \"The Terminater 2\" and \"Lawnmover\\n|> Man\".  We also know something about VR from ABC news magazine and\\n|> Computer Graphics World magazine.\\n\\n\\nUnfortunately, while SGI systems were used to create the special effects\\nfor both Terminator 2 and Lawnmower Man, those are film-quality computer\\ngraphics, rendered in software and written to film a frame at a time.  Each\\nframe of computer animation for those films took hours to render on\\nhigh-end parallel processing computer systems. Thus, that level of graphics\\nwould be difficult, if not impossible, to acheive in real time (30 frames\\nper second).\\n\\n\\n|> \\n|> We certainly want to know more about VR.  Who are the leading\\n|> companies,\\n|> agencies, universities?  What machines support VR (i.e. SGI, Sun4,\\n|> HP-9000, BIM-6000, etc.)?\\n\\n\\nIt depends upon how serious you are and how advanced your application is.\\nTrue immersive visualization (VR), requires the rendering of complex visual\\ndatabases at anywhere from 20 to 60 newly rendered frames per second.  This\\nis a similar requirement to that of traditional flight simulators for pilot\\ntraining. If the frame rate is too low, the user notices the stepping of\\nthe frames as they move their head rapidly around the scene, so the motion\\nof the graphics is not smooth and contiguous.  Thus the graphics system\\nmust be powerful enough to sustain high frame rates while rendering complex\\ndata representations.\\n\\nAdditionally, the frame rate must be constant.  If the system renders 15\\nframes per second at one point, then 60 frames per second the next (perhaps\\ndue to the scene in the new viewing direction being simpler than what was\\nvisible before), the user can get heavily distracted by the medium (the\\ngraphics computer) rather than focusing on the data. To maintain a constant\\nframe rate, the system must be able to run in real-time.  UNIX in general\\ndoes not support real-time operation, but Silicon Graphics has modified the\\nUNIX kernel for its multi-processor systems to be able to support real-time\\noperation, bypassing the usual UNIX process priority-management schemes. \\nUniprocessor systems running UNIX cannot fundamentally support real-time\\noperation (not Sun SPARC10, not HP 700 Series systems, not IBM RS-6000, not\\neven SGI\\'s uniprocessor systems like Indigo or Crimson). Only our\\nmultiprocessor Onyx and Challenge systems support real-time operation due\\nto their Symmetric Multi-Processing (SMP) shared-memory architecture.\\n\\nFrom a graphics perspective, rendering complex virtual environments\\nrequires advanced rendering techniques like texture mapping and real-time\\nmulti-sample anti-aliasing.  Of all of the general purpose graphics systems\\non the market today, only Crimson RealityEngine and Onyx RealityEngine2\\nsystems fully support these capabilities. The anti-aliasing is particularly\\nimportant, as the crawling jagged edges of aliased polygons is an\\nunfortunate distraction when immersed in a virtual environment.\\n\\n\\n|>  What kind of graphics languages are used with VR\\n|> (GL, opengl, Phigs, PEX, GKS, etc.)?\\n\\nYou can use the general purpose graphics libraries listed above to develop\\nVR applications, but that is starting at a pretty low level.

Basically it changes things\\n   when told to by the server and then renders an image from the user's\\n   viewpoint. It also provides the server with information about the user's\\n   actions - which can then be communicated to other clients and therefore to\\n   other users.\\n\\n   The client is designed to be generic - in other words you don't need to\\n   develop a new client when you want to enter a new world. This means that\\n   resources can be spent on enhancing the client software rather than adapting\\n   it. The adaptations, as will be explained in a moment, occur in the servers.\\n\\n   This release of the client software supports the following functionality:\\n\\n    o Hierarchical Objects (with associated addressing)\\n\\n    o Multiple Light Sources and Types (Ambient, Point and Spot)\\n\\n    o User Interface Panels\\n\\n    o Colour Polygonal Rendering with Phong Shading (optional wireframe for\\n\\tfaster frame rates)\\n\\n    o Mouse and Keyboard Input\\n\\n   (Some people may be disappointed that this software doesn't support the\\n   PowerGlove as an input device - this is not because it can't, but because\\n   I don't have one! This will, however, be one of the first enhancements!)\\n\\n  Server(s):\\n   This is where customization can take place. The following basic support is\\n   provided in this release for potential world server developers:\\n\\n    o Transparent Client Management\\n\\n    o Client Message Handling\\n\\n   This may not sound like much, but it takes away the headache of\\naccepting and\\n   terminating clients and receiving messages from them - the\\napplication writer\\n   can work with the assumption that things are happening locally.\\n\\n   Things get more interesting in the object extension functionality. This is\\n   what is provided to allow you to animate your objects:\\n\\n    o Server Selectable Extension Installation:\\n        What this means is that you can decide which objects have extended\\n        functionality in your world. Basically you call the extension\\n        initialisers you want.\\n\\n    o Event Handler Registration:\\n        When you develop extensions for an object you basically write callback\\n        functions for the events that you want the object to respond to.\\n        (Current events supported: INIT, MOVE, CHANGE, COLLIDE & TERMINATE)\\n\\n    o Collision Detection Registration:\\n        If you want your object to respond to collision events just provide\\n        some basic information to the collision detection management software.\\n        Your callback will be activated when a collision occurs.\\n\\n    This software is kept separate from the worldServer applications because\\n    the application developer wants to build a library of extended objects\\n    from which to choose.\\n\\n    The following is all you need to make a World Server application:\\n\\n    o Provide an initWorld function:\\n        This is where you choose what object extensions will be supported, plus\\n        any initialization you want to do.\\n\\n    o Provide a positionObject function:\\n        This is where you determine where to place a new client.\\n\\n    o Provide an installWorldObjects function:\\n        This is where you load the world (.wld) file for a new client.\\n\\n    o Provide a getWorldType function:\\n        This is where you tell a new client what persona they should have.\\n\\n    o Provide an animateWorld function:\\n        This is where you can go wild! At a minimum you should let the objects\\n        move (by calling a move function) and let the server sleep for a bit\\n        (to avoid outrunning the clients).\\n\\n    That's all there is to it! And to prove it here are the line counts for the\\n    three world servers I've provided:\\n\\n        generic - 81 lines\\n        dactyl - 270 lines (more complicated collision detection due to the\\n                           stairs! Will probably be improved with future\\n                           versions)\\n        dogfight - 72 lines\\n\\nLocation:\\n\\n   This software is located at the following site:\\n   ftp.u.washington.edu\\n\\n   Directory:\\n   pub/virtual-worlds\\n\\n   File:\\n   multiverse-1.0.2.tar.Z\\n\\nFutures:\\n\\n   Client:\\n\\n    o Texture mapping.\\n\\n    o More realistic rendering: i.e. Z-Buffering (or similar), Gouraud shading\\n\\n    o HMD support.\\n\\n    o Etc, etc....\\n\\n   Server:\\n\\n    o Physical Modelling (gravity, friction etc).\\n\\n    o Enhanced Object Management/Interaction\\n\\n    o Etc, etc....\\n\\n   Both:\\n\\n    o Improved Comms!!!\\n\\nI hope this provides people with a good understanding of the Multiverse\\nsoftware,\\nunfortunately it comes with practically zero documentation, and I'm not sure\\nwhether that will ever be able to be rectified! :-(\\n\\nI hope people enjoy this software and that it is useful in our explorations of\\nthe Virtual Universe - I've certainly found fascinating developing it, and I\\nwould *LOVE* to add support for the PowerGlove...and an HMD :-)!!\\n\\nFinally one major disclaimer:\\n\\nThis is totally amateur code.

I\\'ve weathered attempted dog attacks before using the\\napproved method: Slow down to screw up dog\\'s triangulation of target,\\nthen take off and laugh at the dog, now far behind you. This time, it\\ndidn\\'t work because I didn\\'t have time. Riding up the hill leading to my\\nhouse, I encountered a liver-and-white Springer Spaniel (no relation to\\nthe Springer Softail, or the Springer Spagthorpe, a close relation to\\nthe Spagthorpe Viking). Actually, the dog encountered me with intent to\\nharm.\\n\\nBut I digress: I was riding near the (unpainted) centerline of the\\nroughly 30-foot wide road, doing between forty and sixty clicks (30 mph\\nfor the velocity-impaired). The dog shot at me from behind bushes on the\\nleft side of the road at an impossibly high speed. I later learned he\\nhad been accelerating from the front porch, about thirty feet away,\\nheading down the very gently sloped approach to the side of the road. I\\nsaw the dog, and before you could say SIPDE, he was on me. Boom! I took\\nthe dog in the left leg, and from the marks on the bike my leg was\\ndriven up the side of the bike with considerable force, making permanent\\nmarks on the plastic parts of the bike, and cracking one panel. I think\\nI saw the dog spin around when I looked back, but my memory of this\\nmoment is hazy.\\n\\nI next turned around, and picked the most likely looking house. The\\napologetic woman explained that the dog was not seriously hurt (cut\\nmouth) and hoped I was not hurt either. I could feel the pain in my\\nshin, and expected a cool purple welt to form soon. Sadly, it has not.\\nSo I\\'m left with a tender shin, and no cool battle scars!\\n\\nInterestingly, the one thing that never happened was that the bike never\\nmoved off course. The not inconsiderable impact did not push the bike\\noff course, nor did it cause me to put the bike out of control from some\\ngut reaction to the sudden impact. Delayed pain may have helped me\\nhere, as I didn\\'t feel a sudden sharp pain that I can remember.\\n\\nWhat worries me about the accident is this: I don\\'t think I could have\\nprevented it except by traveling much slower than I was. This is not\\nnecessarily an unreasonable suggestion for a residential area, but I was\\nriding around the speed limit. I worry about what would have happened if\\nit had been a car instead of a dog, but I console myself with the\\nthought that it would take a truly insane BDI cager to whip out of a\\nblind driveway at 15-30 mph.

THIS VERSION\\nNOW RUNS WITH THINK C, I PROMISE! The Docs now contain a chapter for\\nC programmers on how to use the GrafSys.

Objects, not just simple single-line drawings.\\n\\nGrafSys supports full 3D clipping, animation and some (primitive) hidden-\\nline/hidden-surface drawing with simple commands from within YOUR PROGRAM.\\n\\nGrafSys also supports full eye control with both perspective and parallel\\nprojections (If you can't understand a word, don't worry, this is just showing\\noff for those who know about it. The docs that come with it will try to explain\\nwhat it all means later on). \\n\\nGrafSys provides a powerful interface to supply your own drawing routines with\\ndata so you can use GrafSys to do the 3D transformations and your own routines\\nto do the actual drawing. (Note that GrafSys also provides drawing routines so\\nyou don't have to worry about that if you don't want to)\\n\\nGrafSys 1.11 comes in two versions. One for the 881 and 020 or above \\nprocessors. The other version uses fixed-point arithmetic and runs on any Mac.\\nBoth versions are *100% source compatibel*. \\n\\nGrafSys comes with an extensive manual that teaches you the fundamentals of 3D\\ngraphics and how to use the package.\\n\\nIf demand is big enough I will convert the GrafSys to an object-class library. \\nHowever, I feelt that the way it is implemented now makes it easier to use for\\na lot more people than the select 'OOP-Guild'.\\n\\nGrafSys is free for any non-commercial usage.

The company hopes this single-stage rocket technology\\ndemonstrator will be the first step towards a single-stage-to-orbit (SSTO)\\nrocket ship.\\n\\n        The white conical vehicle was scheduled to go to the White Sands\\nMissile Range in New Mexico this week.  Flight tests will start in\\nmid-June.\\n\\n        Although there wasn\\'t a cloud in the noonday sky, the forecast for\\nSSTO research remains cloudy.  The SDI Organization -- which paid $60\\nmillion for the DC-X -- can\\'t itself afford to fund full development of a\\nfollow-on vehicle.  To get the necessary hundreds of millions required for\\na sub-orbital DC-XA, SDIO is passing a tin cup among its sister government\\nagencies.\\n\\n        SDIO originally funded SSTO research as a way to cut the costs for\\norbital deployments of space-based sensors and weapns.  However, recent\\nchanges in SDI\\'s political marching orders and budget cuts have made SSTO\\nless of a priority.  Today, the agency is more interested in using DC-X as\\na step towards a low-cost, reusable sounding rocket.\\n\\n        SDIO has already done 50 briefings to other government agencies,\\nsaid Col.  Simon \"Pete\" Worden, SDIO\\'s deputy for technology.  But Worden\\ndeclined to say how much the agencies would have to pony up for the\\nprogram. \"I didn\\'t make colonel by telling my contractors how much money I\\nhave available to spend,\" he quipped at a press conference at McDonnell\\nDouglas Astronautics headquarters.\\n\\n        While SDIO has lowered its sights on the program\\'s orbital\\nobjective, agency officials hail the DC-X as an example of the \"better,\\nfaster, cheaper\" approach to hardware development.  The agency believes\\nthis philosophy can produce breakthroughs that \"leapfrog\" ahead of\\nevolutionary technology developments.\\n\\n        Worden said the DC-X illustrates how a \"build a little, test a\\nlittle\" approach can produce results on time and within budget.  He said\\nthe program -- which went from concept to hardware in around 18 months --\\nshowed how today\\'s engineers could move beyond the \"miracles of our\\nparents\\' time.\"\\n\\n        \"The key is management,\" Worden said. \"SDIO had a very light hand\\non this project.  We had only one overworked major, Jess Sponable.\"\\n\\n        Although the next phase may involve more agencies, Worden said\\nlean management and a sense of government-industry partnership will be\\ncrucial. \"It\\'s essential we do not end up with a large management\\nstructure where the price goes up exponentially.\"\\n\\n        SDIO\\'s approach also won praise from two California members of the\\nHouse Science, Space and Technology Committee. \"This is the direction\\nwe\\'re going to have to go,\" said Rep.  George Brown, the committee\\'s\\nDemocratic chairman. \"Programs that stretch aout 10 to 15 years aren\\'t\\nsustainable....NASA hasn\\'t learned it yet.  SDIO has.\"\\n\\n        Rep.  Dana Rohrbacher, Brown\\'s Republican colleague, went further.\\nJoking that \"a shrimp is a fish designed by a NASA design team,\"\\nRohrbacher doubted that the program ever would have been completed if it\\nwere left to the civil space agency.\\n\\n        Rohrbacher, whose Orange County district includes McDonnell\\nDouglas, also criticized NASA-Air Force work on conventional, multi-staged\\nrockets as placing new casings around old missile technology. \"Let\\'s not\\nbuild fancy ammunition with capsules on top.  Let\\'s build a spaceship!\"\\n\\n         Although Rohrbacher praised SDIO\\'s sponsorship, he said the\\nprivate sector needs to take the lead in developing SSTO technology.\\n\\n        McDonnell Douglas, which faces very uncertain prospects with its\\nC-17 transport and Space Station Freedom programs, were more cautious\\nabout a large private secotro commitment. \"On very large ventures,\\ncompanies put in seed money,\" said Charles Ordahl, McDonnell Douglas\\'\\nsenior vice president for space systems. \"You need strong government\\ninvestments.\"\\n\\n        While the government and industry continue to differ on funding\\nfor the DC-XA, they agree on continuing an incremental approach to\\ndevelopment.  Citing corporate history, they liken the process to Douglas\\nAircraft\\'s DC aircraft.  Just as two earlier aircraft paved the way for\\nthe DC-3 transport, a gradual evolution in single-stage rocketry could\\neventually lead to an orbital Delta Clipper (DC-1).\\n\\n        Flight tests this summer at White Sands will \"expand the envelope\"\\nof performance, with successive tests increasing speed and altitude.  The\\nfirst tests will reach 600 feet and demonstrate hovering, verticle\\ntake-off and landing.  The second series will send the unmanned DC-X up to\\n5,000 feet.  The third and final series will take the craft up to 20,000\\nfeet.\\n\\n        Maneuvers will become more complex on third phase.  The final\\ntests will include a \"pitch-over\" manever that rotates the vehicle back\\ninto a bottom-down configuration for a soft, four-legged landing.\\n\\n        The flight test series will be supervised by Charles \"Pete\"\\nConrad, who performed similar maneuvers on the Apollo 12 moon landing.\\nNow a McDonnell Douglas vice president, Conrad paised the vehicles\\naircraft-like approach to operations.  Features include automated\\ncheck-out and access panels for easy maintainance.\\n\\n        If the program moves to the next stage, engine technology will\\nbecome a key consideration.  This engine would have more thrust than the\\nPratt & Whitney RL10A-5 engines used on the DC-X.  Each motor uses liquid\\nhydrogen and liquid oxygen propellants to generate up to 14,760 pounds of\\nthrust\\n\\n        Based on the engine used in Centaur upper stages, the A-5 model\\nhas a thrust champer designed for sea level operation and three-to-on\\nthrottling capability.  It also is designed for repeat firings and rapid\\nturnaround.\\n\\n        Worden said future single-stage rockets could employ\\ntri-propellant engine technology developed in the former Soviet Union.\\nThe resulting engines could burn a dense hydrocarbon fuel at takeoff and\\nthen switch to liquid hydrogen at higher altitudes.\\n\\n        The mechanism for the teaming may already be in place.  Pratt has\\na technology agreement with NPO Energomash, the design bureau responsible\\nfor the tri-propellant and Energia cryogenic engines.\\n\\n\\n',\n",

Here is my $0.02 on this and related subjects.\\n\\nOne is curious to know the real reasons behind this and related\\npublic relations campaign about Iran in recent months. These include:\\n\\n1) Attempts to implicate Iran in the bombing of the New York Trade\\n   Center. Despite great efforts in this direction they have not\\n   succeeded in this. They, however, have indirectly created\\n   the impression that Iran is behind the rise of fundamentalist\\n   Islamic movements and thus are indirectly implicated in this matter.\\n\\n2) Public statements by the Secretary of State Christoffer and\\n   other official sources regarding Iran being a terrorist and\\n   outlaw state.\\n\\n3) And finally the recent broadcast of the Frontline program. I \\n   suspect that this PR campaign against Iran will continue and\\n   perhaps intensify.\\n\\nWhy this increased pressure on Iran? A number of factors may have\\nbeen behind this. These include:\\n\\n1) The rise of Islamic movements in North-Africa and radical\\n   Hamas movement in the Israeli occupied territories. This\\n   movement is basically anti-western and is not necessarily\\n   fueled by Iran. The cause for accelerated pace of this \\n   movement is probably the Gulf War which sought to return\\n   colonial Shieks and Amirs to their throne in the name of\\n   democracy and freedom. Also, the obvious support of Algerian\\n   military coup against the democratically elected Algerian\\n   Islamic Front which clearly exposed the democracy myth.\\n   A further cause of this may be the daily broadcast of the news\\n   on the slaughter of Bosnian Moslems.\\n\\n2) Possible future implications of this movement in Saudi Arabia\\n   and other US client states and endangerment of the cheap oil\\n   sources from this region.\\n\\n3) A need to create an enemy as an excuse for huge defense\\n   expenditures. This has become necessary after the demise of\\n   Soveit Union.\\n\\nThe recent PR campaign against Iran, however, seems to be directed\\nfrom Israel rather than Washington. There is no fundamental conflict\\nof interest between Iran and the US and in my opinion, it is in the\\ninterest of both countries to affect reestablishment of normal\\nand friendly relations. This may have a moderating effect on the\\nrise of radical movements within the Islamic world and Iran .\\n\\n--jamshid\\n',\n",

Then we decided to kill the young deer too,\\n> so as spare it further suffering. I approached, took out my\\n> revolver and shot him in the head several times from a very short\\n> distance. When you shoot straight at the head you actually see the\\n> bullets sinking in.  But my fifth bullet made its brains fall\\n> outside onto the ground, with the effect of splattering lots of\\n> blood straight on us. This made us feel cured of the spurt of our\\n> madness.

The coup d\\'etat \\nengineered by Greece in 1974 to execute a final solution \\nto the Turkish problem was the savage blow that invoked \\nTurkiye\\'s intervention.

This is in dramatic contrast to the Greek motivation which \\nwas openly expansionist, stated as \\'Enosis,\\' union with Greece. \\nSince the creation of independent Cyprus in 1960, the Turkish \\npopulation, although smaller, legally had status as the co-founder\\nof the republic with the Greek population.\\n\\nThe Greek Cypriots, with the support of \\'Enosis\\'-minded\\nGreeks in the mainland, have consistently ignored that\\nstatus and portrayed the Island as a Greek island with\\na minority population of Turks. The Turks of Cyprus are\\nnot a minority in a Greek Republic and they found the\\nonly way they could show that was to assert their \\nautonomy in a separate republic.\\n\\nTurkiye is not satisfied with the status quo. She would\\nrather not be involved with the island. But, given the\\ndismal record of brutal Greek oppression of the Turkish\\npopulation in Cyprus, she simply cannot leave the fate\\nof the island\\'s Turks in the hands of the Greeks until\\nthe Turkish side is satisfied with whatever accord\\nthe two communities finally reach to guarantee that\\nhistory will not repeat itself to rob Turkish Cypriots\\nof their rights, liberties and their very lives.\\n\\n\\n  Source: \\'Cyprus: The Tale Of An Island,\\' A.

Did you ever read newspaper at all?\\n\\n\\n\"PAINFUL SEARCH ..\"\\n\\nTHE GRUESOME extent of February\\'s killings of Azeris by Armenians\\nin the town  of Hojali is at last emerging  in Azerbaijan - about\\n600 men,  women and  children dead  in the  worst outrage  of the\\nfour-year war over Nagorny Karabakh.\\n\\nThe figure  is drawn  from Azeri investigators,  Hojali officials\\nand casualty lists published in the Baku press. Diplomats and aid\\nworkers say the death toll is in line with their own estimates.\\n\\nThe 25  February attack on Hojali  by Armenian forces was  one of\\nthe last moves  in their four-year campaign to  take full control\\nof Nagorny Karabakh,  the subject of a new  round of negotiations\\nin Rome on Monday. The bloodshed was something between a fighting\\nretreat and  a massacre, but  investigators say that most  of the\\ndead were civilians. The awful  number of people killed was first\\nsuppressed by  the fearful  former Communist government  in Baku.\\nLater  it  was blurred  by  Armenian  denials and  grief-stricken\\nAzerbaijan\\'s wild  and contradictory  allegations of up  to 2,000\\ndead.\\n\\nThe State Prosecuter, Aydin Rasulov,  the cheif investigator of a\\n15-man  team  looking  into  what Azerbaijan  calls  the  \"Hojali\\nDisaster\", said  his figure of 600  people dead was a  minimum on\\npreliminary  findings.  A similar  estimate  was  given by  Elman\\nMemmedov, the mayor of Hojali. An  even higher one was printed in\\nthe Baku newspaper  Ordu in May - 479 dead  people named and more\\nthan 200 bodies reported unidentified.  This figure of nearly 700\\ndead is quoted as official by Leila Yunusova, the new spokeswoman\\nof the Azeri Ministry of Defence.\\n\\nFranCois Zen  Ruffinen, head  of delegation of  the International\\nRed Cross  in Baku, said  the Muslim imam  of the nearby  city of\\nAgdam had reported a figure of  580 bodies received at his mosque\\nfrom  Hojali, most  of  them  civilians. \"We  did  not count  the\\nbodies. But  the figure seems  reasonable. It is no  fantasy,\" Mr\\nZen Ruffinen said. \"We have some idea since we gave the body bags\\nand products to wash the dead.\"\\n\\nMr  Rasulov endeavours  to give  an unemotional  estimate of  the\\nnumber of  dead in the  massacre. \"Don\\'t  get worked up.  It will\\ntake  several months  to  get a  final  figure,\" the  43-year-old\\nlawyer said at his small office.\\n\\nMr Rasulov  knows about these  things. It  took him two  years to\\nreach  a firm  conclusion that  131  people were  killed and  714\\nwounded  when  Soviet  troops  and tanks  crushed  a  nationalist\\nuprising in Baku in January 1990.\\n\\nThose  nationalists, the  Popular  Front, finally  came to  power\\nthree weeks  ago and  are applying pressure  to find  out exactly\\nwhat  happened when  Hojali, an  Azeri town  which lies  about 70\\nmiles from the border with Armenia, fell to the Armenians.\\n\\nOfficially, 184 people have so  far been certified as dead, being\\nthe  number of  people that  could be  medically examined  by the\\nrepublic\\'s forensic department. \"This  is just a small percentage\\nof the dead,\" said Rafiq Youssifov, the republic\\'s chief forensic\\nscientist. \"They were the only bodies brought to us. Remember the\\nchaos and the fact that we are  Muslims and have to wash and bury\\nour dead within 24 hours.\"\\n\\nOf these 184 people, 51 were women, and 13 were children under 14\\nyears old.  Gunshots killed  151 people,  shrapnel killed  20 and\\naxes or  blunt instruments  killed 10.  Exposure in  the highland\\nsnows killed the last three.  Thirty-three people showed signs of\\ndeliberate mutilation, including ears,  noses, breasts or penises\\ncut off and  eyes gouged out, according  to Professor Youssifov\\'s\\nreport. Those 184 bodies examined were less than a third of those\\nbelieved to have been killed, Mr Rasulov said.\\n\\nFiles  from  Mr  Rasulov\\'s  investigative  commission  are  still\\ndisorganised -  lists of 44  Azeri militiamen are dead  here, six\\npolicemen there,  and in handwriting  of a mosque  attendant, the\\nnames of  111 corpses brought to  be washed in just  one day. The\\nmost heartbreaking account from  850 witnesses interviewed so far\\ncomes  from Towfiq  Manafov,  an Azeri  investigator  who took  a\\nhelicopter  flight  over  the  escape route  from  Hojali  on  27\\nFebruary.\\n\\n\"There were too many bodies of  dead and wounded on the ground to\\ncount properly: 470-500  in Hojali, 650-700 people  by the stream\\nand the road and 85-100  visible around Nakhchivanik village,\" Mr\\nManafov  wrote in  a  statement countersigned  by the  helicopter\\npilot.\\n\\n\"People waved up  to us for help. We saw  three dead children and\\none  two-year-old alive  by  one  dead woman.  The  live one  was\\npulling at her arm for the mother to get up. We tried to land but\\nArmenians started a barrage against  our helicopter and we had to\\nreturn.\"\\n\\nThere  has been  no consolidation  of  the lists  and figures  in\\ncirculation because  of the political  upheavals of the  last few\\nmonths and the  fact that nobody knows exactly who  was in Hojali\\nat the time - many inhabitants were displaced from other villages\\ntaken over by Armenian forces.\\n\\nTHE INDEPENDENT, London, 12/6/\\'92\\n\\n\\nHEROES WHO FOUGHT ON AMID THE BODIES\\n\\nAREF  SADIKOV sat  quietly  in the  shade of  a  cafe-bar on  the\\nCaspian Sea  esplanade of Baku and  showed a line of  stitches in\\nhis trousers, torn  by an Armenian bullet as he  fled the town of\\nHojali just over three months ago, writes Hugh Pope.\\n\\n\"I\\'m still  wearing the same  clothes, I don\\'t have  any others,\"\\nthe  51-year-old carpenter  said,  beginning his  account of  the\\nHojali disaster. \"I was wounded in five places, but I am lucky to\\nbe alive.\"\\n\\nMr Sadikov and  his wife were short of  food, without electricity\\nfor more than a month, and cut off from helicopter flights for 12\\ndays. They  sensed the  Armenian noose was tightening  around the\\n2,000 to  3,000 people left in  the straggling Azeri town  on the\\nedge of Karabakh.\\n\\n\"At about 11pm  a bombardment started such as we  had never heard\\nbefore,  eight  or  nine   kinds  of  weapons,  artillery,  heavy\\nmachine-guns, the lot,\" Mr Sadikov said.\\n\\nSoon neighbours were  pouring down the street  from the direction\\nof  the  attack. Some  huddled  in  shelters but  others  started\\nfleeing the town,  down a hill, through a stream  and through the\\nsnow into a forest on the other side.\\n\\nTo escape, the  townspeople had to reach the Azeri  town of Agdam\\nabout 15  miles away. They  thought they  were going to  make it,\\nuntil at  about dawn  they reached a  bottleneck between  the two\\nArmenian villages of Nakhchivanik and Saderak.\\n\\n\"None of my group was hurt up to then ...

I\\'m looking for  recommendations for a suitable replacement.  I would\\nlike to buy a full Aerostich suit but I can\\'t afford $700 for it right now.\\n\\nI\\'m considering two basic options:\\n\\n1)  Buy the Aerostich jacket only.  Dunno how much it costs\\n    due to recent price increases, but I\\'d imagine over $400.\\n    That may be pushing my limit.  Advantages include the fact\\n    that I can later add the pants, and that it nearly eliminates\\n    the need for the jacket portion of a rainsuit.\\n\\n2)  Buy some kind of leather jacket.  I like a few of the new \\n    Hein-Gericke FirstGear line, however they may be a bit pricey\\n    unless I can work some sort of deal.  Advantages of leather\\n    are potentially slightly better protection, enhanced pose\\n    value (we all know how important that is :-), possibly cheaper\\n    than upper Aerostich.\\n\\nRequirements for a jacket are that it must fit over a few other \\nlayers (mainly a sizing thing), if leather i\\'d prefer a zip-out \\nlining, it MUST have some body armor similar to aerostich (elbows, \\nshoulders, forearms, possibly back/kidney protection, etc.), a \\nreasonable amount of pocket space would be nice, ventilation would \\nbe a plus, however it must be wearable in cold weather (below\\nfreezing) with layers or perhaps electrics.\\n\\nPlease fire away with suggestions, comments, etc...\\n\\nSteve\\n--\\n-- \\n Steve Andersen  DoD #0239                               andersen@me.udel.edu\\n (302) 832-0136                                     andersen@zr1.ccm.udel.edu\\n 1992 Ducati 907 I.E.                                      1987 Yamaha SRX250\\n \"Life is simply a consequence of the complexities of carbon chemistry...\"\\n',\n",

They left and I had an attack. I realized that the dan-\\nger was past, and stopped controlling myself. I relaxed for a moment and the \\nphysical pain immediately made itself felt. My heart and kidneys hurt. I had \\nan awful kidney attack. I rolled back and forth on top of those Christmas\\nornaments, howling and howling. I didn\\'t know where I was or how long this \\nwent on. When we figured out the time, later it turned out that I howled and \\nwas in pain for around an hour. Then all my strength was gone and I burst into\\ntears, I started feeling sorry for myself, and so on and so forth . . .\\n\\nThen someone came into the room. I think I hear someone calling my name. I \\nwant to respond and restrain myself, I think that I\\'m hallucinating. I am \\nsilent, and then it continues: it seems that first a man\\'s voice is calling\\nme, then a woman\\'s. Later I found out that Mamma had sent our neighbor, the\\none whose apartment she was hiding in, Uncle Sabir Kasumov, to our place, \\ntelling him, \"I know that they\\'ve killed Lyuda. Go there and at least bring \\nher corpse to me so they don\\'t violate her corpse.\" He went and returned empty\\nhanded, but Mamma thought he just didn\\'t want to carry the corpse into his \\napartment. She sent him another time, and then sent his wife, and they were \\nwalking through the rooms looking for me, but I didn\\'t answer their calls. \\nThere was no light, they had smashed the chandeliers and lamps.\\n\\nThey started the pogrom in our apartment around five o\\'clock, and at 9:30 I \\nwent down to the Kasumovs\\'. I went down the stairs myself. I walked out of the\\napartment: how long can you wait for your own death, how long can you be \\ncowardly, afraid? Come what will. I walked out and started knocking on the \\ndoors one after the next. No one, not on the fifth floor, not on the fourth, \\nopened the door. On the third floor, on the landing of the stairway, Uncle \\nSabir\\'s son started to shout, \"Aunt Roza, don\\'t cry, Lyuda\\'s alive!\" He \\nknocked on his own door and out came Aunt Tanya, Igor, and after them, Mamma. \\nAunt Tanya, Uncle Sabir\\'s wife, is an Urdmurt. All of us were in their \\napartment. I didn\\'t see Karina, but she was in their home, too, Lying\\ndelirious, she had a fever. Marina was there too, and my father and mother.\\nAll of my family had gathered there.\\n   \\nAt the door I lost consciousness. Igor and Aunt Tanya carried me into the\\napartment.\\n\\nLater I found out what they had done to our Karina. Mamma said, \"Lyuda, \\nKarina\\'s in really serious condition, she\\'s probably dying. If she recognizes \\nyou, don\\'t cry, don\\'t tell her that her face looks so awful.\" It was as though\\nher whole face was paralyzed, you know, everything was pushed over to one \\nside, her eye was all swollen, and everything flowed together, her lips, her \\ncheeks . . . It was as though they had dragged her right side around the whole\\nmicrodistrict, that\\'s how disfigured her face was. I said, \"Fine.\" Mamma was \\nafraid to go into the room, because she went in and hugged Karina and started \\nto cry. I went in. As soon as I saw her my legs gave way. I fell down near the\\nbed, hugged her legs and started kissing them and crying. She opened the eye \\nthat was intact, looked at me, and said, \"Who is it?\" But I could barely talk, \\nmy whole face was so badly beaten. I didn\\'t say, but rather muttered something\\ntender, something incomprehensible, but tender, \"My Karochka, my Karina, my \\nlittle golden one . . . \" She understood me.\\n\\nThen Igor brought me some water, I drank it down and moistened Karina\\'s lips. \\nShe started to groan. She was saying something to me, but I couldn\\'t \\nunderstand it. Then I made out, \"It hurts, I hurt all over.\" Her hair was \\nglued down with blood. I stroked her forehead, her head, she had grit on her \\nforehead, and on her lips . . . She was groaning again, and I don\\'t know how \\nto help her. She calls me over with her hand, come closer. I go to her. She\\'s\\nsaying something to me, but I can\\'t understand her. Igor brings her a pencil \\nand paper and says, \"Write it down.\" She shakes her head as if to say, no, I \\ncan\\'t write. I can\\'t understand what she\\'s saying. She wanted to tell me \\nsomething, but she couldn\\'t. I say, \"Karina, just lie there a little while,\\nthen maybe you\\'ll feel better and you can tell me then.\" And then she says,\\n\"Maybe it\\'ll be too late.\" And I completely . . . just broke down, I couldn\\'t\\ncontrol myself.\\n\\nThen I moistened my hand in the water and wiped her forehead and eye. I dipped\\na handkerchief into the water and squeezed a little water onto her lips. She \\nsays, \"Lyuda, we\\'re not saved yet, we have to go somewhere else. Out of this \\ndamned house. They want to kill us, I know. They\\'ll find us here, too. We need\\nto call Urshan.\" She repeated this to me for almost a whole hour, Until I \\nunderstood her every word. I ask, \"What\\'s his number?\" Urshan Feyruzovich, \\nthat\\'s the head of the administration where she works. \"We have to call him.\" \\nBut I didn\\'t know his home number. I say, \"Karina, what\\'s his number?\" She \\nsays, \"I can\\'t remember.\" I say, \"Who knows his number? Who can I call?\" She \\nsays, \"I don\\'t know anything, leave me alone.\"\\n\\nI went out of the room. Igor stayed to watch over her and sat there, he was \\ncrying, too. I say, \"Mamma, Karina says that we have to call Urshan. How can \\nwe call him? Who knows his telephone number?\" I tell Marina, \"Think, think, \\nwho can we call to find out?\" She started calling; several people didn\\'t \\nanswer. She called a girlfriend, her girlfriend called another girlfriend and \\nfound out the number and called us back. The boss\\'s wife answered and said he \\nwas at the dacha. My voice keeps cracking, I can\\'t talk normally. She says, \\n\"Lyuda, don\\'t panic, get a hold of yourself, go out to those hooligans and \\ntell them that they just can\\'t do that.\" She still didn\\'t know what was really\\ngoing on. I said, \"It\\'s easy for you to say that, you don\\'t understand what\\'s \\nhappening. They are killing people here. I don\\'t think there is a single \\nArmenian left in the building, they\\'ve cut them all up. I\\'m even surprised \\nthat we managed to save ourselves. \"She says, \"Well, OK, if it\\'s that serious \\n. . . \" And all the same she\\'s thinking that my emotions are all churned up \\nand that I\\'m fearing for my life, that in fact it\\'s not all that bad. \"OK, \\nfine, fine,\" she says, \"if you\\'re afraid, OK, as soon as Urshan comes back \\nI\\'ll send him over.\"\\n\\nWe called again because they had just started robbing the apartment directly \\nunder Aunt Tanya\\'s, on the second floor, Asya Dallakian\\'s apartment. She \\nwasn\\'t home, she was staying with her daughter in Karabagh. They destroyed \\neverything there . . . We realized that they still might come back. We kept on\\ntrying to get through to Aunt Tanya--Urshan\\'s wife is named Tanya too and \\nfinally we get through. She says, \"Yes, he\\'s come home, he\\'s leaving for your \\nplace now.\" He came. Of course he didn\\'t know what was happening, either, \\nbecause he brought two of his daughters with him. He came over in his jeep \\nwith his two daughters, like he was going on an outing. He came and saw what \\nshape we were in and what was going on in town and got frightened. He has \\ngrown up daughters, they\\'re almost my age.\\n\\nThe three of us carried out Karina, tossed a coat on her and a warm scarf, and\\nwent down to his car. He took Karina and me to the Maternity Home. . . No, \\nfirst they took us to the po]ice precinct. They had stretchers ready. As\\nsoon as we got out of the car they put Karina and me on stretchers and said\\nthat we were in serious condition and that we mustn\\'t move, we might have\\nfractures. From the stretcher I saw about 30 soldiers sitting and lying on the\\nfirst floor, bandaged, on the concrete floor, groaning . . . This was around\\neleven o\\'clock at night. We had left the house somewhere around 1:30. When I \\nsaw those soldiers I realized that a war was going on: soldiers, enemies\\n. . . everything just like a war.\\n\\nThey carried me into some office on the stretcher. The emergency medical\\npeople from Baku were there. The medical attendant there was an older \\nArmenian. Urshan told him what they had done to Karina because she\\'s so proud \\nshe would never have told. And this aging Armenian . . . his name was Uncle \\nArkady, I think, because someone said \"Arkady, get an injection ready,\" he \\nstarted to fill a syringe, and turned around so as to give Karina a shot. But \\nwhen he looked at her face he became ill. And he was an old man, in his \\nsixties, his hair was all grey, and his moustache, too. He hugged Karina and \\nstarted to cry: \"What have they done to you?!\" He was speaking Armenian. \"What\\nhave they done to you?!\" Karina didn\\'t say anything. Mamma came in then, and \\nshe started to cry, too. The man tried to calm her. \"I\\'ll give you a shot.\" \\nMamma tells him, \"I don\\'t need any shot. Where is the government? Just what \\nare they doing? Look what they\\'ve done to my children! They\\'re killing people,\\nand you\\'re just sitting here!\" Some teacups were standing on the table in \\nthere. \"You\\'re sitting here drinking tea! Look what they\\'ve done to my \\ndaughters! Look what they\\'ve turned them into!\" They gave her something to \\ndrink, some heart medicine, I think. They gave Karina an injection and the\\ndoctor said that she had to be taken to the Maternity Home immediately. Papa \\nand Urshan, I think, even though Papa was in bad shape, helped carry Karina \\nout. When they put her on the stretcher, none of the medics got near her. I \\ndon\\'t know, maybe there weren\\'t any orderlies. Then they came to me: \"What\\'s \\nthe matter with you?\" Their tone was so official that I wrapped myself tighter\\nin the half-length coat. I had a blanket on, too, an orange one, Aunt Tanya\\'s.\\nI said, \"I\\'m fine.\" Uncle Arkady came over and was soothing me, and then told \\nthe doctor, \"You leave, let a woman examine her.\" A woman came, an \\nAzerbaijani, I believe, and said, \"What\\'s wrong with you?\" I was wearing my \\nsister Lyuda\\'s nightshirt, the sister who at this time was in Yerevan. When \\nshe was nursing her infant she had cut out a big hole in it so that it would \\nbe easier to breast feed the baby. I tore the night shirt some more and showed\\nher. I took it off my shoulders and turned my back to her. There was a huge \\nwound, about the size of a hand, on my back, from the Indian vase. She said \\nsomething to them and they gave me two shots. She said that it should be \\ndressed with something, but that they\\'d do that in the hospital.\\n\\nThey put me on a stretcher, too. They started looking for people to carry me. \\nI raised up my head a little and wanted to sit up, and this woman, I don\\'t \\nknow if she was a doctor or a nurse, said, \"Lie still, you mustn\\'t move.\" When\\nI was lying back down I saw two policemen leading a man. His profile seemed \\nvery familiar to me. I shouted, \"Stop!\" One of the policemen turned and says, \\n\"What do you want?\" I say, \"Bring him to me, I want to look at him.\" They \\nbrought him over and I said, \"That person was just in our apartment and he \\njust raped me and my sister. I recognize him, note it down.\" They said, \\n\"Fine,\" but didn\\'t write it down and led him on. I don\\'t know where they were \\ntaking him.\\n\\nThen they put my stretcher near where the injured and beaten soldiers were \\nsitting. They went to look for the ambulance driver so he would bring the car \\nup closer. One of the soldiers started talking to me, \"Sister . . . \" I don\\'t \\nremember the conversation exactly, but he asked me were we lived and what they\\ndid to us. I asked him, \"Where are you from?\" He said that he was from Ufa. \\nApparently they were the first that were brought in. The Ufa police. Later I \\nlearned that they suffered most of all. He says, \"OK, you\\'re Armenians, they \\ndidn\\'t get along with you, but I\\'m a Russian,\" he says, \"what are they trying \\nto kill me for?\" Oh, I remembered something else. When I went out onto the \\nbalcony with Kuliyev for a hammer and nails I looked out the window and saw \\ntwo Azerbaijanis beating a soldier near the kindergarten. He was pressed \\nagainst the fence and he covered his head with his arms, they were beating him\\nwith his own club. The way he cried \"Mamma\" made my skin crawl. I don\\'t know \\nwhat they did to him, if he\\'s still alive or not. And something else. Before \\nhe attack on our house we saw sheets, clothes, and some dishes flying from the\\nthird or fourth floor of the neighboring building, but I didn\\'t think it was \\nAzerbaijanis attacking Armenians. I thought that something was on fire or they\\nwere throwing something they didn\\'t need out, or someone was fighting with \\nsomeone. It was only later, when they were burning a passenger car in the \\nyard, when the neighbors said that they were doing that to the Armenians, that\\nI realized that this was serious, that it was anti-Armenian.\\n\\nThey took Karina and me to the Sumgait Maternity Home. Mamma went to them too \\nand said, \"I\\'ve been beaten too, help me.\" But they just ignored her. My \\nfather went to them and said in a guilty voice, as though it was his fault \\nthat he\\'d been beaten, and says, \"My ribs hurt so much, those creeps have \\nprobably broken my ribs. Please look at them.\" The doctor says, \"That\\'s not my\\njob.\" Urshan said, \"Fine, I\\'ll take you to my place and if we need a doctor, \\nI\\'ll find you one. I\\'ll bring one and have him look at you. And he drove them \\nto his apartment.\\n\\nMarina and I stayed there. They examined us. I was more struck by what the \\ndoctor said than by what those Azerbaijanis in our apartment did to us. I \\nwasn\\'t surprised when they beat us they wanted to beat us, but I was very\\nsurprised that in a Soviet medical facility a woman who had taken the\\nHippocratic Oath could talk to victims like that. By happy--or unhappy--\\ncoincidence we were seen by the doctor that had delivered our Karina. And she,\\nhaving examined Karina, said, \"No problem, you got off pretty good. Not like \\nthey did in Kafan, when you Armenians were killing and raping our women.\\n\"Karina was in such terrible condition that she couldn\\'t say anything--she\\nwould certainly have had something to say! Then they examined me. The same \\nstory. They put us in a separate ward. No shots, no medicinal powders, no \\ndrugs. Absolutely none! They didn\\'t even give us tea. All the women there soon\\nfound out that in ward such and such were Armenians who had been raped. And\\nthey started coming and peering through the keyhole, the way people look at \\nzoo animals. Karina didn\\'t see this, she was lying there, and I kept her from \\nseeing it.\\n\\nThey put Ira B. in our ward. She had also been raped. True, she didn\\'t have \\nany serious bodily injuries, but when she told me what had happened at their \\nplace, I felt worse for them than I did for us. Because when they raped Ira \\nher daughter was in the room, she was under the bed on which it happened. And\\nIra was holding her daughter\\'s hand, the one who was hiding under the bed.\\nWhen they were beating Ira or taking her earrings off, gold, when she \\ninvoluntarily let go of her daughter\\'s hand, her daughter took her hand again.\\nHer daughter is in the fourth grade, she\\'s 11 years old. I felt really awful \\nwhen I heard that. Ira asked them not to harm her daughter, she said, \"Do what\\nyou want with me, just leave my daughter alone.\" Well, they did what they \\nwanted. They threatened to kill her daughter if she got in their way. Now I \\nwould be surprised if the criminals had behaved any other way that night. It \\nwas simply Bartholomew\\'s Night, I say, they did what they would love to do \\nevery day: steal, kill, rape . . .\\n\\nMany are surprised that those animals didn\\'t harm the children. The beasts \\nexplained it like this: this would be repeated in 15 to 20 years, and those \\nchildren would be grown, and then, as they put it, \"we\\'ll come take the \\npleasure out of their lives, those children.\" This was about the girls that\\nwould be young women in 15 years. They were thinking about their tomorrow \\nbecause they were sure that there would be no trial and no investigation, just\\nas there was no trial or investigation in 1915, and that those girls could be \\nof some use in 15 years. This I heard from the investigators; one of the \\nvictims testified to it. That\\'s how they described their own natures, that\\nthey would still be bloodthirsty in 15 to 20 years, and in 100 years--they\\nthemselves said that.\\n\\nAnd this, too. Everyone is surprised that they didn\\'t harm our Marina. Many \\npeople say that they either were drunk or had smoked too much. I don\\'t know \\nwhy their eyes were red. Maybe because they hadn\\'t slept the night before, \\nmaybe for some other reason, I don\\'t know. But they hadn\\'t been smoking and \\nthey weren\\'t drunk, I\\'m positive, because someone who has smoked will stop at \\nnothing he has the urge to do. And they spoke in a cultured fashion with \\nMarina: \"Little sister, don\\'t be afraid, we won\\'t harm you, don\\'t look over \\nthere [where I was], you might be frightened. You\\'re a Muslim, a Muslim woman \\nshouldn\\'t see such things.\" So they were really quite sober . . .\\n\\nSo we came out of that story alive. Each every day we have lived since it all \\nhappened bears the mark of that day. It wasn\\'t even a day, of those several \\nhours. Father still can\\'t look us in the eyes. He still feels guilty for what\\nhappened to Karina, Mother, and me. Because of his nerves he\\'s started talk-\\ning to himself, I\\'ve heard him argue with himself several times when he\\nthought no one is listening: \"Listen,\" he\\'ll say, \"what could I do? What could\\nI do alone, how could I protect them?\" I don\\'t know where to find the words,\\nit\\'s not that I\\'m happy, but I am glad that he didn\\'t see it all happen. \\nThat\\'s the only thing they spared us . . . or maybe it happened by chance. Of \\ncourse he knows it all, but there\\'s no way you could imagine every last detail\\nof what happened. And there were so many conversations: Karina and I spoke\\ntogether in private, and we talked with Mamma, too. But Father was never\\npresent at those conversations. We spare him that, if you can say that. And\\nwhen the investigator comes to the house, we don\\'t speak with Father present.\\n\\nOn February 29, the next clay, Karina and I were discharged from the hospital.\\nFirst they released me, but since martial law had been declared in the city, \\nthe soldiers took me to the police precinct in an armored personnel carrier. \\nThere were many people there, Armenian victims. I met the Tovmasian family \\nthere. From them I learned that Rafik and their Uncle Grant had died. They \\nwere sure that both had died. They were talking to me and Raya, Rafik\\'s wife \\nand Grant\\'s daughter, and her mother, were both crying.\\n\\nThen they took us all out of the office on the first floor into the yard.\\nThere\\'s a little one-room house outside there, a recreation and reading area.\\nThey took us in there. The women were afraid to go because they thought\\nthat they were shooing us out of the police precinct because it had become\\nso dangerous that even the people working at the precinct wanted to hide.\\nThe women were shouting. They explained to them: \"We want to hide you\\nbetter because it\\'s possible there will be an attack on the police precinct.\"\\n\\nWe went into the little house. There were no chairs or tables in there. We\\nhad children with us and they were hungry; we even had infants who needed to \\nhave their diapers changed. No one had anything with them. It was just awful. \\nThey kept us there for 24 hours. From the window of the one room house you \\ncould see that there were Azerbaijanis standing on the fences around the \\npolice precinct, as though they were spying on us. The police precinct is \\nsurrounded by a wall, like a fence, and it\\'s electrified, but if they were \\nstanding on the wall, it means the electricity was shut off. This brought \\ngreat psychological pressure to bear on us, particularly on those who hadn\\'t \\njust walked out of their apartments, but who hadn\\'t slept for 24 hours, or 48,\\nor those who had suffered physically and spiritually, the ones who had lost \\nfamily members. For us it was another ordeal. We were especially frightened \\nwhen all the precinct employees suddenly disappeared. We couldn\\'t see a single\\nperson, not in the courtyard and not in the windows. We thought that they must\\nhave already been hiding under the building, that they must have some secret \\nroom down there. People were panicking: they started throwing themselves at\\none another . . . That\\'s the way it is on a sinking ship. We heard those \\npeople, mainly young people, whistling and whopping on the walls. We felt that\\nthe end was approaching. I was completely terrified: I had left Karina in the \\nhospital and didn\\'t know where my parents were. I was sort of calm about my \\nparents, I was thinking only about Karina, if, Heaven forbid, they should \\nattack the hospital, they would immediately tell them that there was an \\nArmenian in there, and something terrible would happen to Karina again, and \\nshe wouldn\\'t be able to take it.\\n\\nThen soldiers with dogs appeared. When they saw the dogs some of the people \\nclimbed down off the fence. Then they brought in about another 30 soldiers.\\nThey all had machine guns in readiness, their fingers on the triggers. We \\ncalmed down a little. They brought us chairs and brought the children some \\nlittle cots and showed us where we could wash our hands, and took the children\\nto the toilet. But we all sat there hungry, but to be honest, it would never \\nhave occurred to any of us that we hadn\\'t eaten for two days and that people \\ndo eat.\\n\\nThen, closer to nightfall, they brought a group of detained criminals. They \\nwere being watched by soldiers with guard dogs. One of the men came back from \\nthe courtyard and told us about it. Raya Tovmasian . . . it was like a \\ndifferent woman had been substituted. Earlier she had been crying, wailing, \\nand calling out: \"Oh, Rafik!,\" but when she heard about this such a rage came \\nover her! She jumped up, she had a coat on, and she started to roll up her \\nsleeves like she was getting ready to beat someone. And suddenly there were \\nsoldiers, and dogs, and lots of people. She ran over to them. The bandits were\\nstanding there with their hands above their heads facing the wall. She went up\\nto one of them and grabbed him by the collar and started to shake and thrash \\nhim! Then, on to a second, and a third. Everyone was rooted to the spot. Not \\none of the soldiers moved, no one went up to help or made her stop her from \\ndoing it. And the bandits fell down and covered their heads with their hands, \\nmuttering something. She came back and sat down, and something akin to a smile\\nappeared on her face. She became so quiet: no tears, no cries. Then that round\\nwas over and she went back to beat them again. She was walking and cursing \\nterribly: take that, and that, they killed my husband, the bastards, the \\ncreeps, and so on. Then she came back again and sat down. She probably did \\nthis the whole night through, well, it wasn\\'t really night, no one slept. She \\nwent five or six times and beat them and returned. And she told the women, \\n\"What are you sitting there for? They killed your husbands and children, they \\nraped, and you\\'re just sitting there. You\\'re sitting and talking as though \\nnothing had happened. Aren\\'t you Armenians?\" She appealed to everyone, but no \\none got up. I was just numb, I didn\\'t have the strength to beat anyone, I \\ncould barely hold myself up, all the more so since I had been standing for so \\nmany hours--I was released at eleven o\\'clock in the morning and it was already\\nafter ten at night because there weren\\'t enough chairs, really it was the \\nelderly and women with children who sat. I was on my feet the whole time. \\nThere was nothing to breathe, the door was closed, and the men were smoking. \\nThe situation was deplorable.\\n\\nAt eleven o\\'clock at night policemen came for us, local policemen, \\nAzerbaijanis. They said, \"Get up. They\\'ve brought mattresses, you can wash up\\nand put the children to bed.\" Now the women didn\\'t want to leave this place, \\neither. The place had become like home, it was safe, there were soldiers with \\ndogs. If anyone went outside, the soldiers would say, \"Oh, it\\'s our little \\nfamily,\" and things like that. The soldiers felt this love, and probably, for \\nthe first time in their lives perceived themselves as defenders. Everyone\\nspoke from the heart, cried, and hugged them and they, with their loaded\\nmachine guns in their hands, said, \"Grandmother, you mustn\\'t approach me,\\nI\\'m on guard.\" Our people would say, \"Oh, that\\'s all right.\" They hugged\\nthem, one woman even kissed one of the machine guns. This was all terribly\\nmoving for me. And the small children kept wanting to pet the dogs.\\n\\nThey took us up to the second floor and said, \"You can undress and sleep in \\nhere. Don\\'t be afraid, the precinct is on guard, and it\\'s quiet in the city.\"\\nThis was the 29th, when the killing was going on in block 41A and in other\\nplaces. Then we were told that all the Armenians were being gathered at the\\nSK club and at the City Party Committee. They took us there. On the way I \\nasked them to stop at the Maternity Home: I wanted to take Karina with me.\\nI didn\\'t know what was happening there. They told me, \"Don\\'t worry, the\\nMaternity Home is full of soldiers, more than mothers-to-be. So you can rest\\nassured. I say, \"Well, I won\\'t rest assured regardless, because the staff in\\nthere is capable of anything.\"\\n\\nWhen I arrived at the City Party Committee it turned out that Karina had\\nalready been brought there. They had seen fit to release her from the hospi-\\ntal, deciding that she felt fine and was no longer in need of any care. Once\\nwe were in the City Party Committee we gave free reign to our tears. We met \\nacquaintances, but everyone was somehow divided into two groups, those who \\nhadn\\'t been injured, who were clothed, who had brought a pot of food with \\nthem, and so on, and those, like me, like Raya, who were wearing whatever had \\ncome their way. There were even people who were all made up, dolled up like \\nthey had come from a wedding. There were people without shoes, naked people, \\nhungry people, those who were crying, and those who had lost someone. And of \\ncourse the stories and the talk were flying: \"Oh, I heard that they killed \\nhim!\" \"What do you mean they killed him!\" \"He stayed at work!\" \"Do you know \\nwhat\\'s happening at this and such a plant? Talk like that.\\n\\nAnd then I met Aleksandr Mikhailovich Gukasian, the teacher. I know him very \\nwell and respect him highly. I\\'ve known him for a long time. They had a small \\nroom, well really it was more like a study-room. We spent a whole night \\ntalking in that study once. On March 1 we heard that Bagirov [First Secretary \\nof the Communist Party of Azerbaijan SSR] had arrived. Everyone ran to see \\nBagirov, what news he had brought with him and how this was all being viewed \\nfrom outside. He arrived and everyone went up to him to talk to him and ask \\nhim things. Everyone was in a tremendous rage. But he was protected by \\nsoldiers, and he went up to the second floor and didn\\'t deign to speak with \\nthe people. Apparently he had more important things to do.\\n\\nSeveral hours passed. Gukasian called me and says, \"Lyudochka, find another \\ntwo or three. We\\'re going to make up lists, they asked for them upstairs, \\nlists of the dead, those whose whereabouts are unknown, and lists of people \\nwho had pogroms of their apartments and of those whose cars were burned.\" I \\nhad about 50 people in my list when they called me and said, \"Lyuda, your \\nMamma has arrived, she\\'s looking for you, she doesn\\'t believe that you are \\nalive and well and that you\\'re here.\" I gave the lists to someone and asked \\nthem to continue what I was doing and went off.\\n\\nThe list was imprecise, of course. It included Grant Adamian, Raya Tovmasian\\'s\\nfather, who was alive, but at the time they thought him dead. There was Engels\\nGrigorian\\'s father and aunt, Cherkez and Maria. The list also included the \\nname of my girlfriend and neighbor, Zhanna Agabekian. One of the guys said \\nthat he had been told that they chopped her head off in the courtyard in front\\nof the Kosmos movie theater. We put her on the list too, and cried, but later \\nit turned out that that was just a rumor, that in fact an hour earlier she had\\nsomehow left Sumgait for the marina and from there had set sail for \\nKrasnovodsk, where, thank God, she was alive and well. I should also say that \\nin addition to those who died that list contained people who were rumored \\nmissing or who were so badly wounded that they were given up for dead.                                                                 3\\n\\nAll the lists were taken to Bagirov. I don\\'t remember how many dead were \\ncontained in the list, but it\\'s a fact that when Gukasian came in a couple \\nof minutes later he was cursing and was terribly irate. I asked, \"What\\'s \\ngoing on?\" He said, \"Lyuda, can you imagine what animals, what scoundrels\\nthey are! They say that they lost the list of the dead. Piotr Demichev\\n[Member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party\\nof the USSR] has just arrived, and we were supposed to submit the list to\\nhim, so that he\\'d see the scope of the slaughter, of the tragedy, whether it\\nwas one or fifty.\" They told him that the list had disappeared and they\\nshould ask everyone who hadn\\'t left for the Khimik boarding house all over\\nagain. There were 26 people on our second list. I think that the number 26\\nwas the one that got into the press and onto television and the radio, because\\nthat\\'s the list that Demichev got. I remember exactly that there were 26 \\npeople on the list, I had even told Aleksandr Mikhailovich that that was only \\na half of those that were on the first list. He said, \"Lyuda, please, try to\\nremember at least one more.\" But I couldn\\'t remember anyone else. But there\\nwere more than 30 dead. Of that I am certain. The government and the Procuracy\\ndon\\'t count the people who died of fright, like sick people and old people \\nwhose lives are threatened by any shock. They weren\\'t registered as victims of\\nthe Sumgait tragedy. And then there may be people we didn\\'t know. So many \\npeople left Sumgait between March 1 and 8! Most of them left for smaller towns\\nin Russia, and especially to the Northern Caucasus, to Stavropol, and the \\nKrasnodarsk Territory. We don\\'t have any information on them. I know that \\nthere are people who set out for parts around Moscow. In the periodical \\nKrestyanka [Woman Farmer] there was a call for people who know how to milk \\ncows, and for mechanics, and drivers, and I know a whole group of people went \\nto help out. Also clearly not on our list are those people who died entering\\nthe city, who were burned in their cars. No one knows about them, except the \\nAzerbaijanis, who are hardly likely to say anything about it. And there\\'s\\nmore. A great many of the people who were raped were not included in the list \\ndrawn up at the Procuracy. I know of three instances for sure, and I of course\\ndon\\'t know them all. I\\'m thinking of three women whose parents chose not to \\npublicize what had happened, that is, they didn\\'t take the matter to court, \\nthey simply left. But in so doing they didn\\'t cease being victims. One of them\\nis the first cousin of my classmate Kocharian. She lived in Microdistrict No. \\n8, on the fifth floor. I can\\'t tell you the building number and I don\\'t know \\nher name. Then comes the neighbor of one of my relatives, she lived in \\nMicrodistrict 1 near the gift shop. I don\\'t know her name, she lives on the \\nsame landing as the Sumgait procurator. They beat her father, he was holding \\nthe door while his daughter hid, but he couldn\\'t hold the door forever, and \\nwhen she climbed over the balcony to the neighbors\\' they seized her by her \\nbraid. Like the Azerbaijanis were saying, it was a very cultured mob, because \\nthey didn\\'t kill anyone, they only raped them and left. And the third one \\n. . . I don\\'t remember who the third one was anymore.\\n\\nThey transferred us on March 1. Karina still wasn\\'t herself. Yes, we lived for\\ndays in the SK, in the cultural facility, and at the Khimik. They lived there \\nand I lived at the City Party Committee because I couldn\\'t stay with Karina; \\nit was too difficult for me, but I was at peace: she had survived. I could \\nalready walk, but really it was honest words that held me up. Thanks to the \\nsocial work I did there, I managed to persevere. Aleksandr Mikhailovich said, \\n\"If it weren\\'t for the work I would go insane.\" He and I put ourselves in gear\\nand took everything upon ourselves: someone had an infant and needed diapers \\nand free food, and we went to get them. The first days we bought everything, \\nalthough we should have received it for free. They were supposed to have been \\ndispensed free of charge, and they sold it to us. Then, when we found out it \\nwas free, we went to Krayev. At the time, fortunately, you could still drop by\\nto see him like a neighbor, all the more so since everything was still clearly\\nvisible on our faces. Krayev sent a captain down and he resolved the issue.\\n\\nOn March 2 they sent two investigators to see us: Andrei Shirokov and Vladimir\\nFedorovich Bibishev. The way it worked out, in our family they had considered \\nonly Karina and me victims, maybe because she and I wound up in the hospital.\\nMother and Father are considered witnesses, but not victims.\\n\\nShirokov was involved with Karina\\'s case, and Bibishev, with mine. After I \\ntold him everything, he and I planned to sit down with the identikit and\\nrecord everyone I could remember while everything was still fresh in my mind. \\nWe didn\\'t work with the identikit until the very last day because the\\nconditions weren\\'t there. The investigative group worked slowly and did poor \\nquality work solely because the situation wasn\\'t conducive to working: there \\nweren\\'t enough automobiles, especially during the time when there was a \\ncurfew, and there were no typewriters for typing transcripts, and no still or \\nvideo cameras. I think that this was done on purpose. We\\'re not so poor that \\nwe can\\'t supply our investigators with all that stuff. It was done especially \\nto draw out the investigation, all the more so since the local authorities saw\\nthat the Armenians were leaving at the speed of light, never to return to \\nSumgait. And the Armenians had a lot to say I came to an agreement with \\nBibishev, I told him myself, \"Don\\'t you worry, if it takes us a month or two \\nmonths, I\\'ll be here. I\\'m not afraid, I looked death in the eyes five times in\\nthose two days, I\\'ll help you conduct the investigation.\"\\n\\nHe and I worked together a great deal, and I used this to shelter Karina, I\\ngave them so much to do that for a while they didn\\'t have the time to get to\\nher, so that she would at least have a week or two to get back to being her-\\nself. She was having difficulty breathing so we looked for a doctor to take x-\\nrays. She couldn\\'t eat or drink for nine days, she was nauseous. I didn\\'t eat\\nand drank virtually nothing for five days. Then, on the fifth day, when we\\nwere in Baku already, the investigator told me, \"How long can you go on like \\nthis? Well fine, so you don\\'t want to eat, you don\\'t love yourself, you\\'re\\nnot taking care of yourself, but you gave your word that you would see this\\ninvestigation through. We need you.\" Then I started eating, because in fact I\\nwas exhausted. It wasn\\'t enough that I kept seeing those faces in our apart-\\nment in my mind, every day I went to the investigative solitary confinement\\ncells and prisons. I don\\'t know . . . we were just everywhere! Probably in\\nevery prison in the city of Baku and in all the solitary confinement cells of\\nSumgait. At that time they had even turned the drunk tank into solitary \\nconfinement.\\n\\nThus far I have identified 31 of the people who were in our apartment. Mamma \\nidentified three, and Karina, two. The total is 36. Marina didn\\'t identify \\nanyone, she remembers the faces of two or three, But they weren\\'t among the \\nphotographs of those detained. I told of the neighbor I recognized. The one \\nwho went after the axe. He still hasn\\'t been detained, he\\'s still on the \\nloose. He\\'s gone, and it\\'s not clear if he will be found or not. I don\\'t know \\nhis first or last name. I know which building he lived in and I know his \\nsisters\\' faces. But he\\'s not in the city. The investigators informed me that \\neven if the investigation is closed and even if the trial is over they will \\ncontinue looking for him.\\n\\nThe 31 people I identified are largely blue-collar workers from various \\nplants, without education, and of the very lowest level in every respect.\\nMostly their ages range from 20 to 30 years; there was one who was 48. Only\\none of them was a student. He was attending the Azerbaijan Petroleum and\\nChemical Institute in Sumgait, his mother kept trying to bribe the investiga-\\ntor. Once, thinking that I was an employee and not a victim, she said in front\\nof me \"I\\'ll set you up a restaurant worth 500 rubles and give you 600 in cash\\nsimply for keeping him out of Armenia,\" that is, to keep him from landing in\\na prison on Armenian soil. They\\'re all terribly afraid of that, because if the\\ninvestigator is talking with a criminal and the criminal doesn\\'t confess even\\nthough we identified him, they tell him--in order to apply psychological\\npressure--they say, \"Fine, don\\'t confess, just keep silent. When you\\'re in an\\nArmenian prison, when they find out who you are, they\\'ll take care of you\\nin short order.\" That somehow gets to them. Many give in and start to talk.\\n\\nThe investigators and I were in our apartment and videotaped the entire\\npogrom of our apartment, as an investigative experiment. It was only then\\nthat I saw the way they had left our apartment. Even without knowing who was \\nin our apartment, you could guess. They stole, for example, all the money and \\nall the valuables, but didn\\'t take a single book. They tore them up, burned \\nthem, poured water on them, and hacked them with axes. Only the Materials\\nfrom the 27th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and James \\nFenimore Cooper\\'s Last of the Mohigans. Oh yes, lunch was ready, we were \\nboiling a chicken, and there were lemons for tea on the table. After they had \\nbeen in our apartment, both the chicken and the lemons were gone. That\\'s \\nenough to tell you what kind of people were in our apartment, people who don\\'t\\neven know anything about books. They didn\\'t take a single book, but they did \\ntake worn clothing, food, and even the cheapest of the cheap, worn-out \\nslippers.\\n\\nOf those whom I identified, four were Kafan Azerbaijanis living in Sumgait. \\nBasically, the group that went seeking \"revenge\"--let\\'s use their word for \\nit--was joined by people seeking easy gain and thrill-seekers. I talked with \\none of them. He had gray eyes, and somehow against the back-drop of all that \\nblack I remembered him specifically because of his of his eyes. Besides taking\\npart in the pogrom of our apartment, he was also involved in the murder of \\nTamara Mekhtiyeva from Building 16. She was an older Armenian who had recently\\narrived from Georgia, she lived alone and did not have anyone in Sumgait. I \\ndon\\'t know why she had a last name like that, maybe she was married to an \\nAzerbaijani. I had laid eyes on this woman only once or twice, and know \\nnothing about her. I do know that they murdered her in her apartment with an \\naxe. Murdering her wasn\\'t enough for them. They hacked her into pieces and \\nthrew them into the tub with water.\\n\\nI remember another guy really well too, he was also rather fair-skinned. You \\nknow, all the people who were in our apartment were darker than dark, both \\ntheir hair and their skin. And in contrast with them, in addition to the grey-\\neyed one, I remember this one fellow, the one l took to be a Lezgin. I \\nidentified him. As it turned out he was Eduard Robertovich Grigorian, born\\nin the city of Sumgait, and he had been convicted twice. One of our own. How \\ndid I remember him? The name Rita was tattooed on his left or right hand. I \\nkept thinking, is that Rita or \"puma,\" which it would be if you read the word \\nas Latin characters instead of Cyrillic, because the Cyrillic \"T\" was the one \\nthat looks like a Latin \"M.\" When they led him in he sat with his hands behind\\nhis back. This was at the confrontation. He swore on every holy book, tried to\\nput in an Armenian word here and there to try and spark my compassion, and \\ntold me that I was making a mistake, and called me \"dear sister.\" He said, \\n\"You\\'re wrong, how could I, an Armenian, raise my hand against my own, an \\nArmenian,\" and so on. He spoke so convincingly that even the investigator \\nasked me, \"Lyuda, are you sure it was he?\" I told him, \"I\\'ll tell you one more\\nidentifying mark. If I\\'m wrong I shall apologize and say I was mistaken. The \\nname Rita is tattooed on his left or right hand.\" He went rigid and became \\npale. They told him, \"Put your hands on the table.\" He put his hands on the\\ntable with the palms up. I said, \"Now turn your hands over,\" but he didn\\'t \\nturn his hands over. Now this infuriated me. If he had from the very start\\nacknowledged his guilt and said that he hadn\\'t wanted to do it, that they \\nforced him or something else, I would have treated him somewhat differently.\\nBut he insolently stuck to his story, \"No, I did not do anything, it wasn\\'t \\nme.\" When they turned his hands over the name Rita was in fact tattooed on his\\nhand. His face distorted and he whispered something wicked. I immediately flew\\ninto a rage. There was an ashtray on the table, a really heavy one, made out \\nof granite or something, very large, and it had ashes and butts in it. \\nCatching myself quite by surprise, I hurled that ashtray at him. But he ducked\\nand the ashtray hit the wall, and ashes and butts rained down on his head and \\nback. And he smiled. When he smiled it provoked me further. I don\\'t know how, \\nbut I jumped over the table between us and started either pounding him or \\nstrangling him; I no longer remember which. When I jumped I caught the \\nmicrophone cord. The investigator was there, Tolya . . .I no longer recall his\\nlast name, and he says, \"Lyudochka, it\\'s a Japanese microphone! Please . . .\\n\" And shut off all the equipment on the spot, it was all being video taped. \\nThey took him away. I stayed, and they talked to me a little to calm me down, \\nbecause we needed to go on working, I only remember Tolya telling me, \"You\\'re \\nsome actress! What a performance!\" I said, \"Tolya, honestly . . . \" Beforehand\\nthey would always tell me, \"Lyuda, more emotion. You speak as calmly as if \\nnothing had happened to you.\" I say, \"I don\\'t have any more strength or \\nemotion. All my emotions are behind me now, I no longer have the strength \\n. . . I don\\'t have the strength to do anything.\" And he says, \"Lyuda, how were\\nyou able to do that?\" And when I returned to normal, drinking tea and watching\\nthe tape, I said, \"Can I really have jumped over that table? I never jumped \\nthat high in gym class.\"\\n\\nSo you could say the gang that took over our apartment was international. Of \\nthe 36 we identified there was an Armenian, a Russian, Vadim Vorobyev, who \\nbeat Mamma, and 34 Azerbaijanis.\\n\\nAt the second meeting with Grigorian, when he had completely confessed his \\nguilt, he told of how on February 27 the Azerbaijanis had come knocking. Among\\nthem were guys--if you can call them guys--he knew from prison. They said, \\n\"Tomorrow we\\'re going after the Armenians. Meet us at the bus station at three\\no\\'clock.\" He said, \"No, I\\'m not coming.\" They told him, \"If you don\\'t come \\nwe\\'ll kill you.\" He said, \"Alright, I\\'ll come.\" And he went.\\n\\nThey also went to visit my classmate from our microdistrict, Kamo Pogosian. He\\nhad also been in prison; I think that together they had either stolen a \\nmotorcycle or dismantled one to get some parts they needed. They called him \\nout of his apartment and told him the same thing: \"Tomorrow we\\'re going to get\\nthe Armenians. Be there.\" He said, \"No.\" They pulled a knife on him. He said, \\n\"I\\'m not going all the same.\" And in the courtyard on the 27th they stabbed \\nhim several times, in the stomach. He was taken to the hospital. I know he was\\nin the hospital in Baku, in the Republic hospital. If we had known about that \\nwe would have had some idea of what was to come on the 28th.\\n\\nI\\'ll return to Grigorian, what he did in our apartment. I remember that he\\nbeat me along with all the rest. He spoke Azerbaijani extremely well. But he\\nwas very fair-skinned, maybe that led me to think that they had it out for\\nhim, too. But later it was proved that he took part in the beating and burning\\nof Shagen Sargisian. I don\\'t know if he participated in the rapes in our \\napartment; I didn\\'t see, I don\\'t remember. But the people who were in our \\napartment who didn\\'t yet know that he was an Armenian said that he did. I \\ndon\\'t know if he confessed or not, and I myself don\\'t recall because I blacked\\nout very often. But I think that he didn\\'t participate in the rape of Karina\\nbecause he was in the apartment the whole time. When they carried her into the\\ncourtyard, he remained in the apartment.\\n\\nAt one point I was talking with an acquaintance about Edik Grigorian. From her\\nI learned that his wife was a dressmaker, his mother is Russian, he doesn\\'t \\nhave a father, and that he\\'s been convicted twice. Well this will be his third\\nand, I hope, last sentence. He beat his wife, she was eternally coming to work\\nwith bruises. His wife was an Armenian by the name of Rita.\\n\\nThe others who were detained . . . well they\\'re little beasts. You really can\\'t\\ncall them beasts, they\\'re just little beasts. They were robots carrying out\\nsomeone else\\'s will, because at the investigation they all said, \"I don\\'t \\nunderstand how I could have done that, I was out of my head.\" But we know that\\nthey were won around to it and prepared for it, that\\'s why they did it. In the\\nname of Allah, in the name of the Koran, in the name of propagating Islam--\\nthat\\'s holy to them--that\\'s why they did everything they were commanded to do.\\nBecause I saw they didn\\'t have minds of their own, I\\'m not talking about their\\nlevel of cultural sophistication or any higher values. No education, they\\nwork, have a slew of children without the means to raise them properly, they \\ncrowd them in, like at the temporary housing, and apparently, they were \\npromised that if they slaughtered the Armenians they would receive apartments.\\nSo off they went. Many of them explained their participation saying, \"they \\npromised us apartments.\"\\n\\nAmong them was one who genuinely repented. I am sure that he repented from the\\nheart and that he just despised himself after the incident. He worked at a \\nchildren\\'s home, an Azerbaijani, he has two children, and his wife works at \\nthe children\\'s home too. Everything that they acquired, everything that they \\nhave they earned by their own labor, and wasn\\'t inherited from parents or \\ngrandparents. And he said, \"I didn\\'t need anything I just don\\'t know . . . how\\nI ended up in that; it was like some hand was guiding me. I had no will of my \\nown, I had no strength, no masculine dignity, nothing.\" And the whole time I\\nkept repeating, \"Now you imagine that someone did the same to your young wife \\nright before your own eyes.\" He sat there and just wailed.\\n\\nBut that leader in the Eskimo dogskin coat was not detained. He performed a \\nmarvelous disappearing act, but I think that they\\'ll get onto him, they just \\nhave to work a little, because that Vadim, that boy, according to his\\ngrandfather, is in touch with the young person who taught him what to do, how \\nto cover his tracks. He was constantly exchanging jackets with other boys he \\nknew and those he didn\\'t, either, and other things as well, and changed \\nhimself like a chameleon so they wouldn\\'t get onto him, but he was detained.\\n\\nThat one in the Eskimo dogskin coat was at the Gambarians\\' after Aleksandr \\nGambarian was murdered. He came in and said, \"Let\\'s go, enough, you\\'ve spilled\\nenough blood here.\"\\n\\nMaybe Karina doesn\\'t know this but the reason they didn\\'t finish her off was \\nthat they were hoping to take her home with them. I heard this from Aunt Tanya\\nand her sons, the Kasumovs, who were in the courtyard near the entryway. They \\nliked her very much, and they had decided to take her to home with them. When \\nKarina came to at one point--she doesn\\'t remember this yet, this the neighbors \\nold me--and she saw that there was no one around her, she started crawling to \\nthe entryway. They saw that she was still alive and came back, they were \\nalready at the third entryway, on their way to the Gambarians\\'. They came back\\nand started beating her to finish her. If she had not come to she would have \\nsustained lesser bodily injuries, they would have beat her less. An older \\nwoman from our building, Aunt Nazan, an Azerbaijani, all but lay on top of \\nKarina, crying and pleading that they leave her alone, but they flung her off.\\nThe woman\\'s grown sons were right nearby; they picked her up in their hands \\nand led her home. She howled and cried out loudly and swore: God is on Earth, \\nhe sees everything, and He won\\'t forgive this.\\n\\nThere was another woman, too, Aunt Fatima, a sick, aging woman from the first \\nfloor, she\\'s already retired. Mountain dwellers, and Azerbaijanis, too, have a\\ncustom: If men are fighting, they throw a scarf under their feet to stop them.\\nBut they trampled her scarf and sent her home. To trample a scarf is \\ntantamount to trampling a woman\\'s honor.\\n\\nNow that the investigation is going on, now that a lot is behind us and we \\nhave gotten back to being ourselves a little, I think about how could these \\nevents that are now called the Sumgait tragedy happen? How did they come \\nabout? How did it start? Could it have been avoided? Well, it\\'s clear that \\nwithout a signal, without permission from the top leadership, it would not \\nhave happened. All the same, I\\'m not afraid to say this, the Azerbaijanis,\\nlet other worthy people take no offense, the better representatives of their \\nnations, let them take no offense, but the Azerbaijanis in their majority are \\na people who are kept in line only by fear of the law, fear of retribution for\\nwhat they have done. And when the law said that they could do all that, like\\nunleashed dogs who were afraid they wouldn\\'t have time to do everything, they \\nthrew themselves from one thing to the next so as to be able to get more done,\\nto snatch a bit more. The smell of the danger was already in the air on\\nFebruary 27. You could tell that something was going to happen. And everyone \\nwho had figured it out took steps to avoid running into those gangs. Many left\\nfor their dachas, got plane tickets for the other end of the country, just got\\nas far away as their legs would carry them.\\n\\nFebruary 27 was a Saturday. I was teaching my third class. The director came \\ninto my classroom and said that I should let the children out, that there had \\nbeen a call from the City Party Committee asking that all teachers gather for \\na meeting at Lenin Square. Well, I excused the children, and there were few \\nteachers left at school, altogether three women, the director, and six or \\nseven men. The rest had already gone home. We got to Lenin Square and there \\nwere a great many people there. This was around five-thirty or six in the \\nevening, no later. They were saying all kinds of rubbish up on the podium and \\nthe crowd below was supporting them stormily, roaring. They spoke over the \\nmicrophone about what had happened in Kafan a few days earlier and that the \\ndriver of a bus going to some district had recently thrown a small Azerbaijani\\nchild off the bus. The speaker affirmed that he was an eyewitness, that he had\\nseen it himself..The crowd started to rage: \"Death to the Armenians! They must\\nbe killed!\" Then a woman went up on stage. I didn\\'t see the woman because \\npeople were clinging to the podium like flies. I could only hear her. The \\nwoman introduced herself as coming from Kafan, and said that the Armenians \\ncut her daughters\\' breasts off, and called, \"Sons, avenge my daughters!\" That \\nwas enough. A portion of the people on the square took off running in the \\ndirection of the factories, toward the beginning of Lenin Street.\\n\\nWe stood there about an hour. Then the director of School 25 spoke, he gave a \\nvery nationalist speech. He said, \"Brother Muslims, kill the Armenians!\" This \\nhe repeated every other sentence. When he said this the crowd supported him \\nstormily, whistling and shouting \"Karabagh!\" He said, \"Karabagh has been our \\nterritory my whole life long, Karabagh is my soul. How can you tear out my \\nheart?\" As though an Azerbaijani would die without Karabagh. \"It\\'s our \\nterritory, the Armenians will never see it. The Armenians must be eliminated. \\nFrom time immemorial Muslims have cleansed the land of infidel Armenians, from\\ntime immemorial, that\\'s the way nature created it, that every 20 to 30 years \\nthe Azerbaijanis should cleanse the land of filth.\" By filth he meant \\nArmenians.\\n\\nI heard this. Before that I hadn\\'t been listening to the speeches closely.\\nMany people spoke and I stood with my back to the podium, talking shop with \\nthe other teachers, and somehow it all went right by, it didn\\'t penetrate,\\nthat in fact something serious was taking place. Then, when one of our\\nteachers said, \"Listen to what he\\'s saying, listen to what idiocy he\\'s \\nspouting,\" we listened. That was the speech of that director. Before that we \\nlistened to the woman\\'s speech.\\n\\nRight then in our group--there were nine of us--the mood changed, and the \\nsubject of conversation and all school matters were forgotten. Our director of\\nstudies, for whom I had great respect, he\\'s an Azerbaijani . . . Before that I\\nhad considered him an upstanding and worthy person, if there was a need to \\nobtain leave we had asked him, he seemed like a good person. So he tells me,\\n\"Lyuda, you know that besides you there are no Armenians on the square? If \\nthey find out that you\\'re an Armenian they\\'ll tear you to pieces. Should I \\ntell them you\\'re an Armenian? Should I tell them you\\'re an Armenian?\" When he \\nsaid it the first time I pretended not to hear it, and then he asked me a \\nsecond time. I turned to the director, Khudurova, and said that it was already\\nafter eight, I was expected at home, and I should be leaving. She answered, \\n\"No, they said that women should stay here until ten o\\'clock,.and men, until \\ntwelve. Stay here.\" There was a young teacher with us, her children were in \\nkindergarten and her husband worked shifts. She asked to leave: \"I left my \\nchildren at the kindergarten.\" The director excused her. When she let her go I\\nturned around, said, \"Good-bye,\" and left with the young teacher, the \\nAzerbaijani. I didn\\'t see them after that.\\n\\nWhen we were walking the buses weren\\'t running, and a crowd from the rally ran\\nnearby us. They had apparently gotten all fired up. It must have become too \\nmuch for them, and they wanted to seek vengeance immediately, so they rushed \\noff. I wasn\\'t afraid this time because I was sure that the other teacher \\nwouldn\\'t say that I was an Armenian.\\n\\nTo make it short, we reached home. Then Karina told of how they had been at \\nthe movies and what had happened there. I started telling of my experience and\\nagain my parents didn\\'t understand that we were in danger. We watched \\ntelevision as usual, and didn\\'t even imagine that tomorrow would be our last \\nday. That\\'s how it all was.\\n\\nAt the City Party Committee I met an acquaintance, we went to school together,\\nZhanna, I don\\'t remember her last name, she lives above the housewares store \\non Narimanov Street. She was there with her father, for some reason she \\ndoesn\\'t have a mother. The two of them were at home alone. While her father \\nheld the door she jumped from the third floor, and she was lucky that the \\nground was wet and that there wasn\\'t anyone behind the building when she went \\nout on the balcony, there was no one there, they were all standing near the \\nentryway. That building was also a lucky one in that there were no murders \\nthere. She jumped. She jumped and didn\\'t feel any pain in the heat of the \\nmoment. A few days later I found out that she couldn\\'t stand up, she had been \\ninjured somehow. That\\'s how people in Sumgait saved their lives, their honor, \\nand their children: any way they could. \\n\\nWhere it was possible, the Armenians fought back. My father\\'s first cousin, \\nArmen M., lives in Block 30. They found out by phone from one of the victims \\nwhat was going on in town. The Armenians in that building all called one \\nanother immediately and all of them armed themselves with axes, knives, even \\nwith muskets and went up to the roof. They took their infants with them, and \\ntheir old women who had been in bed for God knows how many months, they got \\nthem right out of their beds and took everyone upstairs. They hooked \\nelectricity up to the trap door to the roof and waited, ready to fight. Then \\nthey took the daughter of the school board director hostage, she\\'s an \\nAzerbaijani who lived in their building. They called the school board director\\nand told her that if she didn\\'t help them, the 17 Armenians on the roof, to \\nescape alive and unharmed, she\\'d never see her daughter again. I\\'m sure, of \\ncourse, that Armenians would never lay a hand on a woman, it was just the only\\nthing that could have saved them at the time. She called the police. The \\nArmenians made a deal with the local police to go into town. Two armored \\npersonnel carriers and soldiers were summoned They surrounded the entryway and\\nled everyone down from the roof, and off to the side from the armored \\npersonnel carriers was a crowd that was on its way to the building at that \\nvery moment, into Block 30. That\\'s how they defended themselves.\\n\\nI heard that our neighbors, Roman and Sasha Gambarian, resisted. They\\'re big, \\nstrong guys. Their father was killed. And I heard that the brothers put up a \\nstrong defense and lost their father, but were able to save their mother.\\n\\nOne of the neighbors told me that after it happened, when they were looking \\nfor the criminals on March 1 to 2 and detaining everyone they suspected, \\npeople hid people in our entryway, maybe people who were injured or perhaps \\ndead. The neighbors themselves were afraid to go there, and when they went \\nwith the soldiers into our basement they are supposed to have found \\nAzerbaijani corpses. I don\\'t know how many. Even if they had been wounded and \\nput down there, after two days they would have died from loss of blood or \\ninfection--that basement was filled with water. I heard this from the \\nneighbors. And later when I was talking with the investigators the subject \\ncame up and they confirmed it. I know, too, that for several hours the \\nbasement was used to store objects stolen from our apartment. And our neighbor\\ncarried out our carpet, along with the rest: he stole it for himself, posing \\nas one of the criminals. Everyone was taking his own share, and the neighbor \\ntook his, too, and carried it home. And when we came back, when everything \\nseemed to have calmed down, he returned it, saying that it was the only thing \\nof ours he had managed to \"save.\"\\n\\nRaya\\'s husband and father defended themselves. The Trdatovs defended \\nthemselves, and so did other Armenian families. To be sure there were\\nAzerbaijani victims, although we\\'ll never hear anything about them. For some \\nreason our government doesn\\'t want to say that the Armenians were not just \\nvictims, but that they defended the honor of their sisters and mothers, too. \\nIn the TV show \"Pozitsiya\" [Viewpoint] a military man, an officer, said that \\nthe Armenians did virtually nothing to defend themselves. But that\\'s not \\nimportant, the truth will come out regardless.\\n\\nSo that\\'s the price we paid those three days. For three days our courage, our \\nbravery, and our humanity was tested. It was those three days, and not the \\nyears and dozens of years we had lived before them, that showed what we\\'ve \\nbecome, what we grew up to be. Those three days showed who was who.\\n\\nOn that I will conclude my narrative on the Sumgait tragedy. It should be said\\nthat it\\'s not over yet, the trials are still ahead of us, and the punishments\\nreceived by those who so violated us, who wanted to make us into nonhumans \\nwill depend on our position and on the work of the investigators, the \\nProcuracy, and literally of every person who lent his hand to the investiga-\\ntion. That\\'s the price we paid to live in Armenia, to not fear going out on \\nthe street at night, to not be afraid to say we\\'re Armenians, and to not fear\\nspeaking our native tongue.\\n\\n   October 15,1988\\n   Yerevan\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t- - - reference for #008 - - -\\n\\n[1] _The Sumgait Tragedy; Pogroms against Armenians in Soviet Azerbaijan,\\n    Volume I, Eyewitness Accounts_, edited by Samuel Shahmuradian, forward by\\n    Yelena Bonner, 1990, published by Aristide D.

We paid for it in human casualties and crippled fates--the\\nprice was too great! Now, after the Sumgait tragedy, we, the victims, divide\\nour lives into \"before\" and \\'\\'after.\" We talk like that: that was before the\\nwar. Like the people who went through World War II and considered it a whole\\nepoch, a fate. No matter how many years go by, no matter how long we live,\\nit will never be forgotten. On the contrary, some of the moments become even \\nsharper: in our rage, in our sorrow, we saw everything differently, but now\\n. . . They say that you can see more with distance, and we can see those\\ninhuman events with more clarity now . . . we more acutely perceive our\\nlosses and everything that happened.\\n\\nNineteen eighty-eight was a leap year. Everyone fears a leap year and wants it\\nto pass as quickly as possible. Yet we never thought that that leap year would\\nbe such a black one for every Sumgait Armenian: those who lost someone and \\nthose who didn\\'t.\\n\\nThat second to last day of winter was ordinary for our family, although you \\ncould already smell danger in the air. But we didn\\'t think that the danger was\\nnear and possible, so we didn\\'t take any steps to save ourselves. At least, as\\nmy parents say, at least we should have done something to save the children. \\nMy parents themselves are not that old, 52 and 53 years. But then they thought\\nthat they had already lived enough, and did everything they could to save us.\\n\\nIn our apartment the tragedy started on February 28, around five in the\\nafternoon. I call it a tragedy, and I repeat: it was a tragedy even though all\\nour family survived. When I recall how they broke down our door my skin\\ncrawls; even now, among Armenians, among people who wish me only well, I feel\\nlike it\\'s all starting over again. I remember how that mob broke into our \\napartment . . . My parents were standing in the hall. My father had an axe in \\nhis hands and had immediately locked both of the doors. Our door was rarely \\nlocked since friends and neighbors often dropped by. We\\'re known as a \\nhospitable family, and we just never really thought about whether the people \\nwho were coming to see us were Azerbaijanis, Jews, or Russians. We had friends\\nof many nationalities, even a Turkmen woman.\\n\\nMy parents were in the hall, my father with an axe. I remember him telling my \\nmother, \"Run to the kitchen for a knife.\" But Mother was detached, pale, as \\nthough she had decided to sell her life a bit dearer. To be honest I never \\nexpected it of her, she\\'s afraid of getting shot and afraid of the dark. A \\ngirlfriend was at the house that day, a Russian girl, Lyuda, and Mamma said, \\n\"No matter what happens, no matter what they do to us, you\\'re not to come out \\nof the bedroom. We\\'re going to tell them that we\\'re alone in the apartment.\"\\n\\nWe went into the bedroom. There were four of us. Marina and the Russian girl \\ncrawled under the bed, and we covered them up with a rug, boxes of dishes, and\\nKarina and I are standing there and looking at one another. The idea that \\nperhaps we were seeing each other for the last time flashed somewhere inside \\nme. I\\'m an emotional person and I express my emotions immediately. I wanted to\\nembrace her and kiss her, as though it were the last second. And maybe Karina \\nwas thinking the same thing, but she\\'s quite reserved. We didn\\'t have time to \\nsay anything to each other because we immediately heard Mamma raise a shout. \\nThere was so much noise from the tramping of feet, from the shouting, and from\\nexcited voices. I couldn\\'t figure what was going on out there because the door\\nto the bedroom was only open a crack. But when Mamma shouted the second time\\nKarina ran out of the bedroom. I ran after her, I had wanted to hold her back,\\nbut when she opened the door and ran out into the hall they saw us \\nimmediately. The only thing I managed to do was close the door behind me, at \\nleast so as to save Marina and her friend. The mob was shouting, all of their \\neyes were shining, all red, like from insomnia. At first about 40 people burst\\nin, but later I was standing with my back to the door and couldn\\'t see. They \\ncame into the hall, into the kitchen, and dragged my father into the other \\nroom. He didn\\'t utter a word, he just raised the axe to hit them, but Mamma \\nsnatched the axe from behind and said, \"Tell them not to touch the children. \\nTell them they can do as they want with us, but not to harm the children.\" She\\nsaid this to Father in Armenian.\\n\\nThere were Azerbaijanis from Armenia among the mob who broke in. They \\nunderstood Armenian perfectly. The local Azerbaijanis don\\'t know Armenian, \\nthey don\\'t need to speak it. And one of them responded in Armenian: \"You and \\nyour children both . . . we\\'re going to do the same thing to you and your \\nchildren that you Armenians did in Kafan. They killed our women, our girls, \\nour mothers, they cut their breasts off, and burned our houses . . . ,\" and \\nso on and so forth, \"and we came to do the same thing to you.\" This whole time\\nsome of them are destroying the house and the others are shouting at us. They \\nwere mostly young people, under 30. At first there weren\\'t any older people \\namong them. And all of their faces were unfamiliar. Sumgait is a small town, \\nall the same, and we know a lot of people by their faces, especially me, I\\'m \\na teacher.\\n\\nSo they dragged my father into the other room. They twisted his arms and took \\nhim in there, no they didn\\'t take him in there, they dragged him in there,\\nbecause he was already unable to walk. They closed the door to that room all \\nbut a crack. We couldn\\'t see what was happening to Father, what they were \\ndoing to him. Then a young man, about 26 years old, started to tear off \\nMamma\\'s sarafan, and Mamma shouted at him in Azerbaijani: \"I\\'m old enough to \\nbe your mother! What are you doing?!\" He struck her. Now he\\'s being held, \\nMamma identified him. I hope he\\'s convicted. Then they went after Karina, \\nwho\\'s been talking to them like a Komsomol leader, as though she were trying \\nto lead them down a different path, as they say, to influence their \\nconsciousness. She told them that what they were doing was wrong, that they \\nmustn\\'t do it. She said, \"Come on, let\\'s straighten this out, without \\nemotions. What do you want? Who are you? Why did you come here? What did we \\never do to you?\" Someone tried to explain who they were and why they had come \\ninto our home, but then the ones in the back--more of them kept coming and \\ncoming--said, \"What are you talking to, them for. You should kill them. We \\ncame here to kill them.\"\\n\\nThey pushed Karina, struck her, and she fell down. They beat her, but she \\ndidn\\'t cry out. Even when they tore her clothes off, she kept repeating, \"What\\ndid we do to you? What did we do to you?\" And even later, when she came to, \\nshe said, \"Mamma, what did we do to them? Why did they do that to us?\"\\n\\nThat group was prepared, I know this because I noticed that some of them only \\nbroke up furniture, and others only dealt with us. I remember that when they \\nwere beating me, when they were tearing my clothes off, I felt neither pain \\nnor shame because my entire attention was riveted to Karina. All I could do \\nwas watch how much they beat her and how painful it was for her, and what they\\ndid to her. That\\'s why I felt no pain. Later, when they carried Karina off, \\nthey beat her savagely . . . It\\'s really amazing that she not only lived, but \\ndidn\\'t lose her mind . She is very beautiful and they did everything they \\ncould to destroy her beauty. Mostly they beat her face, with their fists, \\nkicking her, using anything they could find.\\n\\nMamma, Karina, and I were all in one room. And again I didn\\'t feel any pain, \\njust didn\\'t feel any, no matter how much they beat me, no matter what they \\ndid. Then one of those creeps said that there wasn\\'t enough room in the\\napartment. They broke up the beds and the desk and moved everything into the \\ncorners so there would be more room. Then someone suggested, \"Let\\'s take her \\noutside.\"\\n\\nThose beasts were in Heaven. They did what they would do every day if they \\nweren\\'t afraid of the authorities. Those were their true colors. At the time \\nI thought that in fact they would always behave that way if they weren\\'t \\nafraid of what would happen to them.\\n\\nWhen they carried Karina out and beat Mamma-her face was completely covered \\nwith blood--that\\'s when I started to feel the pain. I blacked out several \\ntimes from the pain, but each moment that I had my eyes open it was as though \\nI were recording it all on film. I think I\\'m a kind person by nature, but I\\'m \\nvengeful, especially if someone is mean to me, and I don\\'t deserve it. I hold \\na grudge a long time if someone intentionally causes me pain. And every time \\nI would come to and see one of those animals on top of me, I\\'d remember them, \\nand I\\'ll remember them for the rest of my life, even though people tell me \\n\"forget,\" you have to forget, you have to go on living.\\n\\nAt some point I remember that they stood me up and told me something, and \\ndespite the fact that I hurt all over--I had been beaten terribly--I found\\nthe strength in myself to interfere with their tortures. I realized that I had\\nto do something: resist them or just let them kill me to bring my suffering \\nto an end. I pushed one of them away, he was a real horse. I remember now that\\nhe\\'s being held, too. As though they were all waiting for it, they seized me\\nand took me out onto the balcony. I had long hair, and it was stuck all over\\nme. One of the veranda shutters to the balcony was open, and I realized that\\nthey planned to throw me out the window, because they had already picked me up\\nwith their hands, I was up in the air. As though for the last time I took a \\nreally deep breath and closed my eyes, and somehow braced myself inside, I \\nsuddenly became cold, as though my heart had sunk into my feet. And suddenly \\nI felt myself flying. I couldn\\'t figure out if I was really flying or if I \\njust imagined it. When I came to I thought now I\\'m going to smash on the \\nground. And when it didn\\'t happen I opened my eyes and realized that I was \\nstill lying on the floor. And since I didn\\'t scream, didn\\'t beg them at all,\\nthey became all the more wild, like wolves. They started to trample me with\\ntheir feet. Shoes with heels on them, and iron horseshoes, like they had spe-\\ncially put them on. Then I lost consciousness.\\n\\nI came to a couple of times and waited for death, summoned it, beseeched it. \\nSome people ask for good health, life, happiness, but at that moment I didn\\'t \\nneed any of those things. I was sure that none of us would survive, and I had \\neven forgotten about Marina; and if none of us was alive, it wasn\\'t worth \\nliving.\\n\\nThere was a moment when the pain was especially great. I withstood inhuman \\npain, and realized that they were going to torment me for a long time to come \\nbecause I had showed myself to be so tenacious. I started to strangle myself, \\nand when I started to wheeze they realized that with my death I was going to\\nput an end to their pleasures, and they pulled my hands from my throat. The \\nperson who injured and insulted me most painfully I remember him very well, \\nbecause he was the oldest in the group. He looked around 48. I know that he \\nhas four children and that he considers himself an ideal father and person, \\none who would never do such a thing. Something came over him then, you see, \\neven during the investigation he almost called me \"daughter,\" he apologized, \\nalthough, of course, he knew that I\\'d never forgive him. Something like that \\nI can never forgive. I have never injured anyone with my behavior, with my \\nwords, or with my deeds, I have always put myself in the other person\\'s shoes,\\nbut then, in a matter of hours, they trampled me entirely. I shall never \\nforget it.\\n\\nI wanted to do myself in then, because I had nothing to lose, because no one \\ncould protect me. My father, who tried to do something against that hoard of \\nbeasts by himself, could do nothing and wouldn\\'t be able to do anything.\\nI knew that I was even sure that he was no longer alive.\\n\\nAnd Ira Melkumian, my acquaintance I knew her and had been to see her family a\\ncouple of times--her brother tried to save her and couldn\\'t, so he tried to \\nkill her, his very own sister. He threw an axe at her to kill her and put an \\nend to her suffering. When they stripped her clothes off and carried her into \\nthe other room, her brother knew what awaited her. I don\\'t know which one it \\nwas, Edik or Igor. Both of them were in the room from which the axe was \\nthrown. But the axe hit one of the people carrying her and so they killed her \\nand made her death even more excruciating, maybe the most excruciating of all \\nthe deaths of those days in Sumgait. I heard about it all from the neighbor \\nfrom the Melkumians\\' landing. His name is Makhaddin, he knows my family a \\nlittle. He came to see how we had gotten settled in the new apartment in Baku,\\nhow we were feeling, and if we needed anything. He\\'s a good person. He said, \\n\"You should praise God that you all survived. But what I saw with my own eyes,\\nI, a man, who has seen so many people die, who has lived a whole life, I,\" he\\nsays, \"nearly lost my mind that day. I had never seen the likes of it and \\nthink I never shall again.\" The door to his apartment was open and he saw \\neverything. One of the brothers threw the axe, because they had already taken \\nthe father and mother out of the apartment. Igor, Edik, and Ira remained. He \\nsaw Ira, naked, being carried into the other room in the hands of six or seven\\npeople. He told us about it and said he would never forget it. He heard the \\nbrothers shouting something, inarticulate from pain, rage, and the fact that \\nthey were powerless to do anything. But all the same they tried to \\ndo something. The guy who got hit with the axe lived.                                                                           I     I\\n\\nAfter I had been unsuccessful at killing myself I saw them taking Marina and \\nLyuda out of the bedroom. I was in such a state that I couldn\\'t even \\nremember my sister\\'s name. I wanted to cry \"Marina!\" out to her, but could\\nnot. I looked at her and knew that it was a familiar, dear face, but couldn\\'t\\nfor the life of me remember what her name was and who she was. And thus\\nI saved her, because when they were taking her out, she, as it turns out, had\\ntold them that she had just been visiting and that she and Lyuda were both\\nthere by chance, that they weren\\'t Armenians. Lyuda\\'s a Russian, you can tell \\nright away, and Marina speaks Azerbaijani wonderfully and she told them that\\nshe was an Azerbaijani. And I almost gave her away and doomed her. I\\'m glad \\nthat at least Marina came out of this all in good physical health . . . \\nalthough her spirit was murdered . . .\\n\\nAt some point I came to and saw Igor, Igor Agayev, my acquaintance, in that \\nmob. He lives in the neighboring building. For some reason I remembered his \\nname, maybe I sensed my defense in him. I called out to him in Russian, \"Igor,\\nhelp!\" But he turned away and went into the bedroom. Just then they were \\ntaking Marina and Lyuda out of the bedroom. Igor said he knew Marina and \\nLyuda, that Marina in fact was Azerbaijani, and he took both of them to the \\nneighbors.\\n\\nAnd the idea stole through me that maybe Igor had led them to our apartment, \\nsomething like that, but if he was my friend, he was supposed to save me.\\n \\nThen they were striking me very hard--we have an Indian vase, a metal one, \\nthey were hitting me on the back with it and I blacked out--they took me out \\nonto the balcony a second time to throw me out the window. They were already \\nsure that I was dead because I didn\\'t react at all to the new blows. Someone \\nsaid, \"She\\'s already dead, let\\'s throw her out.\" When they carried me out onto\\nthe balcony for the second time, when I was about to die the second time, I \\nheard someone say in Azerbaijani: \"Don\\'t kill her, I know her, she\\'s a \\nteacher.\" I can still hear that voice ringing in my ears, but I can\\'t remember\\nwhose voice it was. It wasn\\'t Igor, because he speaks Azerbaijani with an \\naccent: his mother is Russian and they speak Russian at home. He speaks\\nAzerbaijani worse than our Marina does. I remember when they carried me in and\\nthrew me on the bed he came up to me, that person, and \\tI having opened my \\neyes, saw and recognized that person, but immediately passed out cold. I had \\nbeen beaten so much that I didn\\'t have the strength to remember him. I only \\nremember that this person was older and he had a high position. Unfortunately \\nI can\\'t remember anything more.\\n\\nWhat should I say about Igor? He didn\\'t treat me badly. I had heard a lot \\nabout him, that he wasn\\'t that good a person, that he sometimes drank too\\nmuch. Once he boasted to me that he had served in Afghanistan. He knew that \\nwomen usually like bravery in a man. Especially if a man was in Afghanistan,\\nif he was wounded, then it\\'s about eighty percent sure that he will be treated\\nvery sympathetically, with respect. Later I found out that he had served in \\nUfa, and was injured, but that\\'s not in Afghanistan, of course. I found that \\nall out later.\\n\\nAmong the people who were in our apartment, my Karina also saw the Secretary \\nof the Party organization. I don\\'t know his last name, his first name is \\nNajaf, he is an Armenian-born Azerbaijani. But later Karina wasn\\'t so sure,\\nshe was no longer a hundred percent sure that it was he she saw, and she \\ndidn\\'t want to endanger him. She said, \"He was there,\" and a little while \\nlater, \"Maybe they beat me so much that I am confusing him with someone else. \\nNo, it seems like it was he.\" I am sure it was he because when he came to see \\nus the first time he said one thing, and the next time he said something \\nentirely different. The investigators haven\\'t summoned him yet. He came to see\\nus in the Khimik boarding house where we were living at the time. He brought \\ngroceries and flowers, this was right before March 8th; he almost started \\ncrying, he was so upset to see our condition. I don\\'t know if he was putting \\nus on or not, but later, after we had told the investigator and they summoned \\nhim to the Procuracy, he said that he had been in Baku, he wasn\\'t in Sumgait. \\nThe fact that he changed his testimony leads me to believe that Karina is \\nright, that in fact it was he who was in our apartment. I don\\'t know how the \\ninvestigators are now treating him. At one point I wondered and asked, and was\\ntold that he had an alibi and was not in our apartment. Couldn\\'t he have gone \\nto Baku and arranged an alibi? I\\'m not ruling out that possibility.\\n\\nIll now return to our apartment. Mamma had come to. You could say that she \\nbought them off with the gold Father gave her when they were married: her \\nwedding band and her watch were gold. She bought her own and her husband\\'s \\nlives with them. She gave the gold to a 14-year old boy. Vadim Vorobyev. A \\nRussian boy, he speaks Azerbaijani perfectly. He\\'s an orphan who was raised by\\nhis grandfather and who lives in Sumgait on Nizami Street. He goes to a \\nspecial school, one for mentally handicapped children. But I\\'ll say this--I\\'m \\na teacher all the same and in a matter of minutes I can form an opinion--that\\nboy is not at all mentally handicapped. He\\'s healthy, he can think just fine, \\nand analyze, too . . . policemen should be so lucky. And he\\'s cunning, too. \\nAfter that he went home and tore all of the pictures out of his photo album.\\n\\nHe beat Mamma and demanded gold, saying, \"Lady, if you give us all the gold \\nand money in your apartment we\\'ll let you live.\" And Mamma told them where \\nthe gold was. He brought in the bag and opened it, shook out the contents, and \\neveryone who was in the apartment jumped on it, started knocking each other \\nover and taking the gold from one another. I\\'m surprised they didn\\'t kill one \\nanother right then.\\n\\nMamma was still in control of herself. She had been beaten up, her face was\\nblack and blue from the blows, and her eyes were filled with blood, and she \\nran into the other room. Father was lying there, tied up, with a gag in his\\nmouth and a pillow over his face. There was a broken table on top of the pil-\\nlow. Mamma grabbed Father and he couldn\\'t walk; like me, he was half dead, \\nhalfway into the other world. He couldn\\'t comprehend anything, couldn\\'t see, \\nand was covered with black and blue. Mamma pulled the gag out of his mouth, \\nit was some sort of cloth, I think it was a slipcover from an armchair.\\n\\nThe bandits were still in our apartment, even in the room Mamma pulled Father \\nout of, led him out of, carried him out of. We had two armchairs in that room,\\na small magazine table, a couch, a television, and a screen. Three people \\nwere standing next to that screen, and into their shirts, their pants, \\neverywhere imaginable, they were shoving shot glasses and cups from the coffee\\nservice--Mamma saw them out of the corner of her eye. She said, \"I was afraid \\nto turn around, I just seized Father and started pulling him, but at the \\nthreshold I couldn\\'t hold him up, he fell down, and I picked him up again and \\ndragged him down the stairs to the neighbors\\'.\" Mamma remembered one of the \\ncriminals, the one who had watched her with his face half-turned toward her, \\nout of one eye. She says, \"I realized that my death would come from that \\nperson. I looked him in the eyes and he recoiled from fear and went stealing.\"\\nLater they caught that scoundrel. Meanwhile, Mamma grabbed Father and left.\\n\\nI was alone. Igor had taken Marina away, Mamma and Father were gone, Karina \\nwas already outside, I didn\\'t know what they were doing to her. I was left all\\nalone, and at that moment . . . I became someone else, do you understand? Even\\nthough I knew that neither Mother and Father in the other room, nor Marina and\\nLyuda under the bed could save me, all the same I somehow managed to hold out.\\nI went on fighting them, I bit someone, I remember, and I scratched another. \\nBut when I was left alone I realized what kind of people they were, the ones \\nI had observed, the ones who beat Karina, what kind of people they were, the \\nones who beat me, that it was all unnecessary, that I was about to die and \\nthat all of that would die with me.\\n\\nAt some point I took heart when I saw the young man from the next building. I \\ndidn\\'t know his name, but we would greet one another when we met, we knew that\\nwe were from the same microdistrict. When I saw him I said, \"Neighbor, is that\\nyou?\" In so doing I placed myself in great danger. He realized that if I lived\\nI would remember him. That\\'s when he grabbed the axe. The axe that had been \\ntaken from my father. I automatically fell to my knees and raised my hands to \\ntake the blow of the axe, although at the time it would have been better if he\\nhad struck me in the head with the axe and put me out of my misery. When he \\nstarted getting ready to wind back for the blow, someone came into the room. \\nThe newcomer had such an impact on everyone that my neighbor\\'s axe froze in \\nthe air. Everyone stood at attention for this guy, like soldiers in the \\npresence of a general. Everyone waited for his word: continue the atrocities \\nor not. He said, \"Enough, let\\'s go to the third entryway.\" In the third \\nentryway they killed Uncle Shurik, Aleksandr Gambarian. This confirms once \\nagain that they had prepared in advance. Almost all of them left with him, as \\nthey went picking up pillows, blankets, whatever they needed, whatever they \\nfound, all the way up to worn out slippers and one boot, someone else had \\nalready taken the other.\\n\\nFour people remained in the room, soldiers who didn\\'t obey their general. They\\nhad to have come recently, because other faces had flashed in front of me over\\nthose 2 to 3 hours, but I had never seen those three. One of them, Kuliyev (I \\nidentified him later), a native of the Sisian District of Armenia, an \\nAzerbaijani, had moved to Azerbaijan a year before. He told me in Armenian:\\n\"Sister, don\\'t be afraid, I\\'ll drive those three Azerbaijanis out of here.\"\\nThat\\'s just what he said, \"those Azerbaijanis,\" as though he himself were not \\nAzerbaijani, but some other nationality, he said with such hatred, \"I\\'ll drive\\nthem out of here now, and you put your clothes on, and find a hammer and nails\\nand nail the door shut, because they\\'ll be coming back from Apartment 41.\" \\nThat\\'s when I found out that they had gone to Apartment 41. Before that, the \\nperson in the Eskimo dogskin coat, the one who came in and whom they listened \\nto, the \"general,\" said that they were going to the third entryway.\\n\\nKuliyev helped me get some clothes on, because l couldn\\'t do it by myself. \\nMarina\\'s old fur coat was lying on the floor. He threw it over my shoulders, I\\nwas racked with shivers, and he asked where he could find nails and a hammer. \\nHe wanted to give them to me so that when he left I could nail the door shut. \\nBut the door was lying on the floor in the hall.\\n\\nI went out onto the balcony. There were broken windows, and flowers and dirt \\nfrom flowerpots were scattered on the floor. It was impossible to find \\nanything. He told me, \"Well, fine, I won\\'t leave you here. Would any of the \\nneighbors let you in? They\\'ll be back, they won\\'t calm down, they know you\\'re \\nalive.\" He told me all this in Armenian.\\n\\nThen he returned to the others and said, \"What are you waiting for? Leave!\" \\nThey said, \"Ah, you just want to chase us out of here and do it with her \\nyourself. No, we want to do it to.\" He urged them on, but gently, not \\ncoarsely, because he was alone against them, although they were still just\\nboys, not old enough to be drafted. He led them out of the room, and went\\ndown to the third floor with them himself, and said, \"Leave. What\\'s the mat-\\nter, aren\\'t you men? Go fight with the men. What do you want of her?\" And\\nhe came back upstairs. They wanted to come up after him and he realized that \\nhe couldn\\'t hold them off forever. Then he asked me where he could hide me. I \\ntold him at the neighbors\\' on the fourth floor, Apartment 10, we were on really\\ngood terms with them.\\n\\nWe knocked on the door, and he explained in Azerbaijani. The neighbor woman \\nopened the door and immediately said, \"I\\'m an Azerbaijani.\" He said, \"I know. \\nLet her sit at your place a while. Don\\'t open the door to anyone, no one knows\\nabout this, I won\\'t tell anyone. Let her stay at your place.\" She says, \"Fine,\\nhave her come in.\" I went in. She cried a bit and gave me some stockings, I \\nhad gone entirely numb and was racked with nervous shudders. I burst into \\ntears. Even though I was wearing Marina\\'s old fur coat, it\\'s a short one, a \\nhalf-length, I was cold all the same. I asked, \"Do you know where my family \\nis, what happened to them?\" She says, \"No, I don\\'t know anything. I\\'m afraid \\nto go out of the apartment, now they\\'re so wild that they don\\'t look to see \\nwho\\'s Azerbaijani and who\\'s Armenian.\" Kuliyev left. Ten minutes later my \\nneighbor says, \"You know, Lyuda, I don\\'t want to lose my life because of you, \\nor my son and his wife. Go stay with someone else.\" During the butchery in our\\napartment one of the scum, a sadist, took my earring in his mouth--I had pearl\\nearrings on--and ripped it out, tearing the earlobe. The other earring was \\nstill there. When I\\'m nervous I fix my hair constantly, and then, when I \\ntouched my ear, I noticed that I had one earring on. I took it out and gave it\\nto her. She took the earring, but she led me out of the apartment.\\n\\nI went out and didn\\'t know where to go. I heard someone going upstairs. I \\ndon\\'t know who it was but assumed it was them. With tremendous difficulty I \\nend up to our apartment, I wanted to die in my own home. I go into the \\napartment and hear that they are coming up to our place, to the fifth floor. \\nI had to do something. I went into the bedroom where Marina and Lyuda had \\nhidden and saw that the bed was overturned. Instead of hiding I squatted near \\nsome broken Christmas ornaments, found an unbroken one, and started sobbing. \\nThen they came in. Someone said that there were still some things to take. I \\nthink that someone pushed me under the bed. I lay on the floor, and there were\\nbroken ornaments on it, under my head and legs. I got all cut up, but I lay \\nthere without moving. My heart was beating so hard it seemed the whole town \\ncould hear it. There were no lights on. Maybe that\\'s what saved me. They were \\nburning matches, and toward the end they brought in a candle. They started\\npicking out the clothes that could still be worn. They took Father\\'s sport \\njacket and a bedspread, the end of which was under my head. They pulled on the\\none end, and it felt like they were pulling my hair out. I almost cried out. \\nAnd again I realized I wasn\\'t getting out of there alive, and I started to \\nstrangle myself again. I took my throat in one hand, and pressed the other on \\nmy mouth, so as not to wheeze, so that I would die and they would only find me\\nafterward. They were throwing the burned matches under the bed, and I got \\nburned, but I withstood it. Something inside of me held on, someone\\'s hand was\\nprotecting me to the end. I knew that I was going to die, but I didn\\'t know \\nhow. I knew that if I survived I would walk out of that apartment, but if \\nI found out that one of my family had died, I would die for sure, because I \\nhad never been so close to death and couldn\\'t imagine how you could go on \\nliving without your mother or father, or without your sister. Marina, I \\nthought, was still alive: she went to Lyuda\\'s place or someone is hiding her. \\nI tried to think that Igor wouldn\\'t let them be killed. He served in \\nAfghanistan, he should protect her.\\n\\nWhile I was strangling myself I said my good-byes to everyone. And then I\\nthought, how could Marina survive alone. If they killed all of us, how would \\nshe live all by herself? There were six people in the room. They talked among \\nthemselves and smoked. One talked about his daughter, saying that there was no\\nchildren\\'s footwear in our apartment that he could take for his daughter. \\nAnother said that he liked the apartment--recently we had done a really good \\njob fixing everything up--and that he would live there after everything was \\nall over. They started to argue. A third one says, \"How come you get it? I \\nhave four children, and there are three rooms here, that\\'s just what I need. \\nAll these years I\\'ve been living in God-awful places.\" Another one says, \\n\"Neither of you gets it. We\\'ll set fire to it and leave.\" Then someone said \\nthat Azerbaijanis live right next door, the fire could move over to their\\nplace. And they, to my good fortune, didn\\'t set fire to the apartment, and\\nleft.\\n\\nOh, yes, I just remembered. While they were raping me they repeated quite \\nfrequently, \"Let the Armenian women have babies for us, Muslim babies, let \\nthem bear Azerbaijanis for the struggle against the Armenians.\" Then they \\nsaid, \"Those Muslims can carry on our holy cause. Heroes!\" They repeated it \\nvery often.\\n\\n\\t\\t     - - - reference for #008 - - -\\n\\n[1] _The Sumgait Tragedy; Pogroms against Armenians in Soviet Azerbaijan,\\n    Volume I, Eyewitness Accounts_, edited by Samuel Shahmuradian, forward by\\n    Yelena Bonner, 1990, published by Aristide D.

       "  'From: kjenks@gothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov\\nSubject: Space Station Redesign, JSC Alternative #4\\nOrganization: NASA/JSC/GM2, Space Shuttle Program Office \\nX-Newsreader: TIN [version 1.1 PL8]\\nLines: 71\\n\\nI have 19 (2 MB worth!) uuencode\\'d GIF images contain charts outlining\\none of the many alternative Space Station designs being considered in\\nCrystal City.  Mr. Mark Holderman works down the hall from me, and can\\nbe reached for comment at (713) 483-1317, or via e-mail at\\nmholderm@jscprofs.nasa.gov.\\n\\nMark proposed this design, which he calls \"Geode\" (\"rough on the\\noutside, but a gem on the inside\") or the \"ET Strongback with\\nintegrated hab modules and centrifuge.\"  As you can see from file\\ngeodeA.gif, it uses a Space Shuttle External Tank (ET) in place of much\\nof the truss which is currently part of Space Station Freedom.  The\\nwhite track on the outside of the ET is used by the Station Remonte\\nManipulator System (SRMS) and by the Reaction Control System (RCS)\\npod.  This allows the RCS pod to move along the track so that thrusting\\ncan occur near the center of gravity (CG) of the Station as the mass\\nproperties of the Station change during assembly.\\n\\nThe inline module design allows the Shuttle to dock more easily because\\nit can approach closer to the Station\\'s CG and at a structurally strong\\npart of the Station.  In the current SSF design, docking forces are\\nlimited to 400 pounds, which seriously constrains the design of the\\ndocking system.\\n\\nThe ET would have a hatch installed pre-flight, with little additional\\nlaunch mass.  We\\'ve always had the ability to put an ET into orbit\\n(contrary to some rumors which have circulated here), but we\\'ve never\\nhad a reason to do it, while we have had some good reasons not to\\n(performance penalties, control, debris generation, and eventual\\nde-orbit and impact footprint).  Once on-orbit, we would vent the\\nresidual H2.  The ET insulation (SOFI) either a) erodes on-orbit from\\nimpact with atomic Oxygen, or b) stays where it is, and we deploy a\\nKevlar sheath around it to protect it and keep it from contaminating\\nthe local space environment.  Option b) has the advantage of providing\\nfurther micrometeor protection.  The ET is incredibly strong (remember,\\nit supports the whole stack during launch), and could serve as the\\nnucleus for a much more ambitious design as budget permits.\\n\\nThe white module at the end of ET contains a set of Control Moment\\nGyros to be used for attitude control, while the RCS will be used\\nfor gyro desaturation.  The module also contains a de-orbit system\\nwhich can be used at the end of the Station\\'s life to perform a\\ncontrolled de-orbit (so we don\\'t kill any more kangaroos, like we\\ndid with Skylab).\\n\\nThe centrifuge, which has the same volume as a hab module, could be\\nused for long-term studies of the effects of lunar or martian gravity\\non humans.  The centrifuge will be used as a momentum storage device\\nfor the whole attitude control system.  The centrifuge is mounted on\\none of the modules, opposite the ET and the solar panels.\\n\\nThis design uses most of the existing SSF designs for electrical,\\ndata and communication systems, getting leverage from the SSF work\\ndone to date.\\n\\nMark proposed this design at Joe Shea\\'s committee in Crystal City,\\nand he reports that he was warmly received.  However, the rumors\\nI hear say that a design based on a wingless Space Shuttle Orbiter\\nseems more likely.\\n\\nPlease note that this text is my interpretation of Mark\\'s design;\\nyou should see his notes in the GIF files.  \\n\\nInstead of posting a 2 MB file to sci.space, I tried to post these for\\nanon-FTP in ames.arc.nasa.gov, but it was out of storage space.

Can anybody deny these facts?\\n\\nJews killed Germans in WWII -- Germans killed Jews in WWII, BUT there was \\nquite a difference in these two statements, regardless of what Nazi \\nrevisionists say!\\n\\n[SY] My grand parents were living partly in todays Armenia and partly in\\n[SY] todays Georgia. There were villages, Kurd/Turk (different Turkic groups)\\n[SY] Georgian (muslim/christian) Armenian and Farsi... Very near to eachother.\\n[SY] The people living there were aware of their differences. They were \\n[SY] different people. For example, my grandfather would not have been happy \\n[SY] if his doughter had willed to marry an Armenian guy. But that did not \\n[SY] mean that they were willing to kill eachother. No! They were neighbors.\\n\\nOK.\\n\\n[SY] Armenians killed Turks. Which Armenians? Their neoghbors? As far as my\\n[SY] grandparents are concerned, the Armenians attacked first but these \\n[SY] Armenians were not their neighbors. They came from other places. Maybe \\n[SY] first they had a training at some place. They were taught to kill people,\\n[SY] to hate Turks/Kurds? It seems so...\\n\\nThere is certainly a difference between the planned extermination of the\\nArmenians of eastern Turkey beginning in 1915, with that of the Armeno-\\nGeorgian conflicts of late 1918! The argument is not whether Armenians ever \\nkilled in their collective existence, but rather the wholesale destruction of\\nAnatolian Armenians under orders of the Turkish government. An Armenian-\\nGeorgian dispute over the disposition of Akhalkalak, Lori, and Pambak after\\nthe Turkish Third Army evacuated the region, cannot be equated with the\\nextermination of Anatolian Armenians. Many Armenians and Georgians died\\nin this area in the scramble to re-occupy these lands and the lack of\\npreparation for the winter months. This is not the same as the Turkish \\ngenocide of the Armenians nearly four years earlier, hundreds of kilometers\\naway!\\n\\n[SY] Anyway, but after they killed/raped/... Turks and other muslim people\\n[SY] around, people assumed that \\'Armenians killed us, raped our women\\',\\n[SY] not a particular group of people trained in some camps, maybe backed\\n[SY] by some powerful states... After that step, you cannot explain these \\n[SY] people not to hate all Armenians. \\n\\nI don\\'t follow, perhaps the next paragraph will shed some light.\\n\\n[SY] So what am I trying to point out? First, at least for that region,\\n[SY] you cannot blame Turks/Kurds etc since it was a self defense situation.\\n[SY] Most of the Armenians, I think, are not to blame either. But since some\\n[SY] people started that fire, it is not easy to undo it. There are facts.\\n[SY] People cannot trust eachother easily. It is very difficult to establish\\n[SY] a good relation based on mutual respect and trust between nations with\\n[SY] different ethnic/cultural/religious backgrounds but it is unfortunately\\n[SY] very easy to start a fire!\\n\\nAgain, the fighting between Armenians and Georgians in 1918/19 had little to\\ndo with the destruction of the Armenians in Turkey. It is interesting that\\nthe Georgian leaders of the Transcaucasian Federation (Armenia, Azerbaijan, \\nand Georgia) made special deals with Turkish generals not to pass through \\nTiflis on their way to Baku, in return for Georgians not helping the Armenians \\nmilitarily. Of course, as Turkish troops marched across what was left of\\nCaucasian Armenia, many Armenians went north and such population movement \\ncaused problems with the locals. This is in no comparison with events 4 years \\nearlier in eastern Anatolia. My father\\'s mother\\'s family escaped Cemiskezek -> \\nErzinka -> Erzerum -> Nakhitchevan -> Tiflis -> Constantinople -> \\nMassachusetts. \\n\\n[SY] My grandparents were *not* bloodthirsty people. We did not experience\\n[SY] what they had to endure... They had to leave their lands, there were\\n[SY] ladies, old ladies, all of her children killed while she forced to\\n[SY] witness! Young women put dirt at their face to make themselves\\n[SY] unattractive! I don\\'t want to go into any graphic detail.\\n\\nMy grandmother\\'s brother was forced to dress up as a Kurdish women, and paste\\npotato skins on his face to look ugly. The Turks would kill any Armenian\\nyoung man on sight in Dersim. Because their family was rather influential,\\nlocal Kurds helped them escape before it was too late. This is why I am alive \\ntoday.\\n\\n[SY] You may think that my sources are biased. They were biased in some sense.\\n[SY] They experienced their own pain, of course. That is the way it is.

It uses freon jets for\\nsteering and a pulse-width-modulated controller for alignment (ie\\nduring our eight minutes in space, the jets are pretty much\\ncontinuously firing on a ~10% duty cycle or so...).

A genocide of Armenians took place\\nduring peacetime.\\n\\nAnd it was a great tragedy for me personally, because I lost my father in\\nthose days. He was still young. Born in 1926.\\n\\nOn that day, February 28, we were at home. Of course we had heard that there \\nwas unrest in town, my younger brother Aleksandr had told us about it. But we \\ndidn\\'t think . . . we thought that everything would happen outdoors, that they\\nwouldn\\'t go into people\\'s apartments. About five o\\'clock we saw a large crowd \\nnear the Kosmos movie theater in our microdistrict. We were sitting at home \\nwatching television. We go out on the balcony and see the crowd pour into Mir \\nStreet. This is right near downtown, next to the airline ticket office, our \\nhouse is right nearby. That day there was a group of policeman with shields\\nthere. They threw rocks at those policemen. Then they moved off in the \\ndirection of our building. They burned a motorcycle in our courtyard and \\nstarted shouting for Armenians to come out of the building. We switched off \\nthe light. As it turns out, their signal was just the opposite: to turn on the\\nlight. That meant that it was an Azerbaijani home. We, of course, didn\\'t know \\nand thought that if they saw lights on they would come to our apartment.\\n\\nSuddenly there\\'s pounding on the door. We go to the door, all four of us:\\nthere were four of us in the apartment. Father, Mother, my younger brother\\nAleksandr, and I. He was born in 1959. My father was a veteran of World War \\nII and had fought in China and in the Soviet Far East; he was a pilot.\\n\\nWe went to the door and they started pounding on it harder, breaking it down \\nwith axes. We start to talk to them in Azerbaijani, \"What\\'s going on? What\\'s \\nhappened?\" They say, \"Armenians, get out of here!\" We don\\'t open the door, we \\nsay, \"If we have to leave, we\\'ll leave, we\\'ll leave tomorrow.\" They say, \"No, \\nleave now, get out of here, Armenian dogs, get out of here!\" By now they\\'ve \\nbroken the door both on the lock and the hinge sides. We hold them off as best\\nwe can, my father and I on one side, and my mother and brother on the other. \\nWe had prepared ourselves: we had several hammers and an axe in the apartment,\\nand grabbed what we could find to defend ourselves. They broke in the door and\\nwhen the door gave way, we held it for another half-hour. No neighbors, no\\npolice and no one from the city government came to our aid the whole time. We \\nheld the door. They started to smash the door on the lock side, first with an \\naxe, and then with a crowbar.\\n\\nWhen the door gave way--they tore it off its hinges--Sasha hit one of them \\nwith the axe. The axe flew out of his hands. They also had axes, crowbars, \\npipes, and special rods made from armature shafts. One of them hit my father \\nin the head. The pressure from the mob was immense. When we retreated into the\\nroom, one of them hit my mother, too, in the left part of her face. My brother\\nSasha and I fought back, of course. Sasha is quite strong and hot-tempered, he\\nwas the judo champion of Sumgait. We had hammers in our hands, and we injured \\nseveral of the bandits--in the heads and in the eyes, all that went on. But \\nthey, the injured ones, fell back, and others came to take their places, there\\nwere many of them.\\n\\nThe door fell down at an angle. The mob tried to remove the door, so as to go \\ninto the second room and to continue . . . to finish us off. Father brought \\nskewers and gave them to Sasha and me--we flew at them when we saw Father \\nbleeding: his face was covered with blood, he had been wounded in the head, \\nand his whole face was bloody. We just threw ourselves on them when we saw \\nthat. We threw ourselves at the mob and drove back the ones in the hall, drove\\nthem down to the third floor. We came out on the landing, but a group of the \\nbandits remained in one of the rooms they were smashing all the furniture in \\nthere, having closed the door behind them. We started tearing the door off to \\nchase away the remaining ones or finish them. Then a man, an imposing man of \\nabout 40, an Azerbaijani, came in. When he was coming in, Father fell down and\\nMother flew to him, and started to cry out. I jumped out onto the balcony and \\nstarted calling an ambulance, but then the mob started throwing stones through\\nthe windows of our veranda and kitchen. We live on the fourth floor. And no \\none came. I went into the room. It seemed to me that this man was the leader \\nof the group. He was respectably dressed in a hat and a trench coat with a \\nfur collar. And he addressed my mother in Azerbaijani: \"What\\'s with you, \\nwoman, why are you shouting? What happened? Why are you shouting like that?\"\\nShe says, \"What do you mean, what happened? You killed somebody!\" My father \\nwas a musician, he played the clarinet, he played at many weddings, Armenian \\nand Azerbaijani, he played for many years. Everyone knew him. Mother says, \\n\"The person who you killed played at thousands of Azerbaijani weddings, he \\nbrought so much joy to people, and you killed that person.\" He says, \"You \\ndon\\'t need to shout, stop shouting.\" And when they heard the voice of this \\nman, the 15 to 18 people who were in the other room opened the door and \\nstarted running out. We chased after them, but they ran away. That man left, \\ntoo. As we were later told, downstairs one of them told the others, I don\\'t \\nknow if it was from fright or what, told them that we had firearms, even\\nthough we only fought with hammers and an axe. We raced to Father and started \\nto massage his heart, but it was already too late. We asked the neighbors to \\ncall an ambulance. The ambulance never came, although we waited for it all \\nevening and all through the night.\\n\\nSomewhere around midnight about 15 policemen came. They informed us they were \\nfrom Khachmas. They said, \"We heard that a group was here at your place, you \\nhave our condolences.\" They told us not to touch anything and left. Father lay\\nin the room.\\n\\nSo we stayed home. Each of us took a hammer and a knife. We sat at home. Well,\\nwe say, if they descend on us again we\\'ll defend ourselves. Somewhere around \\none o\\'clock in the morning two people came from the Sumgait Procuracy, \\ninvestigators. They say, \"Leave everything just how it is, we\\'re coming back \\nhere soon and will bring an expert who will record and photograph everything.\"\\nThen people came from the Republic Procuracy too, but no one helped us take \\nFather away. The morning came and the neighbors arrived. We wanted to take \\nFather away somehow. We called the Procuracy and the police a couple of times,\\nbut no one came. We called an ambulance, and nobody came. Then one of the \\nneighbors said that the bandits were coming to our place again and we should \\nhide. We secured the door somehow or other. We left Father in the room and \\nwent up to the neighbor\\'s.\\n\\nThe excesses began again in the morning. The bandits came in several vehicles,\\nZIL panel trucks, and threw themselves out of the vehicles like . . . a \\nlanding force near the center of town. Our building was located right there. A\\ncrowd formed. Then they started fighting with the soldiers. Then, in Buildings\\n19 and 20, that\\'s next to the airline ticket office, they started breaking \\ninto Armenian apartments, destroying property, and stealing. The Armenians \\nweren\\'t at home, they had managed to flee and hide somewhere. And again they \\npoured in the direction of our building. They were shouting that there were \\nsome Armenians left on the fourth floor, meaning us. \"They\\'re up there, still,\\nup there. Let\\'s go kill them!\" They broke up all the furniture remaining in \\nthe two rooms, threw it outside, and burned it in large fires. We were hiding \\none floor up. Something heavy fell. Sasha threw himself toward the door \\nshouting that it was probably Father, they had thrown Father, were defiling \\nthe corpse, probably throwing it in the fire, going to burn it. I heard it, \\nand the sound was kind of hollow, and I said, \"No, that\\'s from some of the \\nfurniture.\" Mother and I pounced on Sasha and stopped him somehow, and calmed \\nhim down.\\n\\nThe mob left somewhere around eight o\\'clock. They smashed open the door and \\nwent into the apartment of the neighbors across from us. They were also\\nArmenians, they had left for another city.\\n\\nThe father of the neighbor who was concealing us came and said, \"Are you \\ncrazy? Why are you hiding Armenians? Don\\'t you now they\\'re checking all the \\napartments? They could kill you and them!\" And to us :\" . . . Come on, leave \\nthis apartment!\" We went down to the third floor, to some other neighbors\\'. At\\nfirst the man didn\\'t want to let us in, but then one of his sons asked him and\\nhe relented. We stayed there until eleven o\\'clock at night. We heard the sound\\nof motors. The neighbors said that it was armored personnel carriers. We went \\ndownstairs. There was a light on in the room where we left Father. In the \\nother rooms, as we found out later, all the chandeliers had been torn down. \\nThey left only one bulb. The bulb was burning, which probably was a signal \\nthey had agreed on because there was a light burning in every apartment in our\\nMicrodistrict 3 where there had been a pogrom.\\n\\nWith the help of the soldiers we made it to the City Party Committee and were \\nsaved. Our salvation--my mother\\'s, my brother\\'s, and mine,--was purely \\naccidental, because, as we later found out from the neighbors, someone in the \\ncrowd shouted that we had firearms up there. Well, we fought, but we were only\\nable to save Mother. We couldn\\'t save Father. We inflicted many injuries on \\nthe bandits, some of them serious. But others came to take their places. We \\nwere also wounded, there was blood, and we were scratched all over--we got our\\nshare. It was a miracle we survived. We were saved by a miracle and the \\ntroops. And if troops hadn\\'t come to Sumgait, the slaughter would have been \\neven greater: probably all the Armenians would have been victims of the \\ngenocide.\\n\\nThrough an acquaintance at the City Party Committee I was able to contact the \\nleadership of the military unit that was brought into the city, and at their \\norders we were assigned special people to accompany us, experts. We went to \\'\\npick up Father\\'s corpse. We took it to the morgue. This was about two o\\'clock \\nin the morning, it was already March 1, it was raining very hard and it was \\nquite cold, and we were wearing only our suits. When my brother and I carried \\nFather into the morgue we saw the burned and disfigured corpses. There were \\nabout six burned people in there, and the small corpse of a burned child. It \\nwas gruesome. I suffered a tremendous shock. There were about ten people \\nthere, but the doctor on duty said that because of the numbers they were being\\ntaken to Baku. There was a woman\\'s corpse there too, she had been . . . well, \\nthere was part of a body there . . . a hacked-off part of a woman\\'s body. It \\nwas something terrible. The morgue was guarded by the landing force . . . The \\nchild that had been killed was only ten or twelve years old. It was impossible\\nto tell if it was a boy or a girl because the corpse was burned. There was a \\nman there, too, several men. You couldn\\'t tell anything because their faces \\nwere disfigured, they were in such awful condition...\\n\\nNow two and a half months have passed. Every day I recall with horror what \\nhappened in the city of Sumgait. Every day: my father, and the death of my \\nfather, and how we fought, and the people\\'s sorrow, and especially the morgue.\\n\\nI still want to say that 70 years have passed since Soviet power was\\nestablished, and up to the very last minute we could not conceive of what \\nhappened  in Sumgait. It will go down in history.\\n\\nI\\'m particularly surprised that the mob wasn\\'t even afraid of the troops. They\\neven fought the soldiers. Many soldiers were wounded. The mob threw fuel \\nmixtures onto the armored personnel carriers, setting them on fire. They \\nweren\\'t afraid. They were so sure of their impunity that they attacked our \\ntroops. I saw the clashes on February 29 near the airline ticket office, right\\nacross from our building. And that mob was fighting with the soldiers. The \\ninhabitants of some of the buildings, also Azerbaijanis, threw rocks at the \\nsoldiers from windows, balconies, even cinder blocks and glass tanks. They \\nweren\\'t afraid of them. I say they were sure of their impunity. When we were \\nat the neighbors\\' and when they were robbing homes near the airline ticket \\noffice I called the police at number 3-20-02 and said that they were robbing \\nArmenian apartments and burning homes. And they told me that they knew that \\nthey were being burned. During those days no one from the police department \\ncame to anyone\\'s aid. No one came to help us, either, to our home, even though\\nperhaps they could have come and saved us.\\n\\nAs we later found out the mob was given free vodka and drugs, near the bus \\nstation. Rocks were distributed in all parts of town to be thrown and used in \\nfighting. So I think all of it was arranged in advance. They even knew in \\nwhich buildings and apartments the Armenians lived, on which floors--they had\\nlists, the bandits. You can tell that the \"operation\" was  planned in advance.\\n\\nThanks, of course, to our troops, to the country\\'s leadership, and to the\\nleadership of the Ministry of Defense for helping us, thanks to the Russian\\npeople, because the majority of the troops were Russians, and the troops \\nsuffered losses, too. I want to express this gratitude in the name of my \\nfamily and in the name of all Armenians, and in the name of all Sumgait\\nArmenians. For coming in time and averting terrible things: worse would\\nhave happened if that mob had not been stopped on time.\\n\\nAt present an investigation is being conducted on the part of the USSR\\nProcuracy. I want to say that those bandits should receive the severest\\npossible punishment, because if they don\\'t, the tragedy, the genocide, could \\nhappen again. Everyone should see that the most severe punishment is meted\\nout for such deeds.\\n\\nVery many bandits and hardened hooligans took part in the unrest, in the mass \\ndisturbances. The mobs were huge. At present not all of them have been caught,\\nvery few of them have been, I think, judging by the newspaper reports. There \\nwere around 80 people near our building alone, that\\'s how many people took \\npart in the pogrom of our building all in all.\\n\\nThey should all receive the most severe punishment so that others see that \\nretribution awaits those who perform such acts.\\n\\n   May 18, 1988\\n   Yerevan\\n\\n\\t\\t     - - - reference - - -\\n\\n[1] _The Sumgait Tragedy; Pogroms against Armenians in Soviet Azerbaijan,\\n    Volume I, Eyewitness Accounts_, edited by Samuel Shahmuradian, forward by\\n    Yelena Bonner, 1990, published by Aristide D.

During the Russian occupation of Erzurum, no Armenian\\n was permitted to approach the city and its environs.\\n\\n While the Commander of the First Army Corps, General Kaltiyin remained\\n in power, troops including Armenian enlisted men, were not sent to the\\n area. When the security measures were lifted, the Armenians began to \\n attack Erzurum and its surroundings. Following the attacks came the\\n plundering of the houses in the city and the villages and the murder\\n of the owners of these houses...Plundering was widely committed by\\n the soldiers. This plunder was mainly committed by Armenian soldiers\\n who had remained in the rear during the war.\\n\\n One day, while passing through the streets on horseback, a group of\\n soldiers including an Armenian soldier began to drag two old men of\\n seventy years in a certain direction. The roads were covered with mud,\\n and these people were dragging the two helpless Turks through the mud\\n and dirt...\\n\\n It was understood later that all these were nothing but tricks and\\n traps. The Turks who joined the gendarmarie soon changed their minds\\n and withdrew. The reason was that most of the Turks who were on night\\n patrol did not return, and no one knew what had happened to them. The \\n Turks who had been sent outside the city for labour began to disappear\\n also. Finally, the Court Martial which had been established for the\\n trials of murderers and plunderers, began to liquidate itself for\\n fear that they themselves would be punished. The incidents of murder\\n and rape, which had decreased, began to occur more frequently.\\n\\n Sometime in January and February, a leading Turkish citizen Haci Bekir\\n Efendi from Erzurum, was killed one night at his home. The Commander\\n in Chief (Odiselidge) gave orders to find murderers within three days.\\n The Commander in Chief has bitterly reminded the Armenian intellectuals\\n that disobedience among the Armenian enlisted men had reached its\\n highest point, that they had insulted and robbed the people and half\\n of the Turks sent outside the city had not returned.\\n\\n ...We learnt the details this incident from the Commander-in-Chief,\\n Odishelidge. They were as follows:\\n\\n The killings were organized by the doctors and the employers, and the\\n act of killing was committed solely by the Armenian renegades...\\n More than eight hundred unarmed and defenceless Turks have been\\n killed in Erzincan. Large holes were dug and the defenceless \\n Turks were slaughtered like animals next to the holes. Later, the\\n murdered Turks were thrown into the holes. The Armenian who stood \\n near the hole would say when the hole was filled with the corpses:\\n \\'Seventy dead bodies, well, this hole can take ten more.\\' Thus ten\\n more Turks would be cut into pieces, thrown into the hole, and when\\n the hole was full it would be covered over with soil.\\n\\n The Armenians responsible for the act of murdering would frequently\\n fill a house with eighty Turks, and cut their heads off one by one.\\n Following the Erzincan massacre, the Armenians began to withdraw\\n towards Erzurum... The Armenian renegades among those who withdrew\\n to Erzurum from Erzincan raided the Moslem villages on the road, and\\n destroyed the entire population, together with the villages.\\n\\n During the transportation of the cannons, ammunition and the carriages\\n that were outside the war area, certain people were hired among the \\n Kurdish population to conduct the horse carriages. While the travellers\\n were passing through Erzurum, the Armenians took advantage of the time\\n when the Russian soldiers were in their dwellings and began to kill\\n the Kurds they had hired. When the Russian soldiers heard the cries\\n of the dying Kurds, they attempted to help them. However, the \\n Armenians threatened the Russian soldiers by vowing that they would\\n have the same fate if they intervened, and thus prevented them from\\n acting. All these terrifying acts of slaughter were committed with\\n hatred and loathing.\\n\\n Lieutenant Medivani from the Russian Army described an incident that\\n he witnessed in Erzurum as follows: An Armenian had shot a Kurd. The\\n Kurd fell down but did not die. The Armenian attempted to force the\\n stick in his hand into the mouth of the dying Kurd. However, since\\n the Kurd had firmly closed his jaws in his agony, the Armenian failed\\n in his attempt. Having seen this, the Armenian ripped open the abdomen\\n of the Kurd, disembowelled him, and finally killed him by stamping\\n him with the iron heel of his boot.\\n\\n Odishelidge himself told us that all the Turks who could not escape\\n from the village of Ilica were killed. Their heads had been cut off\\n by axes. He also told us that he had seen thousands of murdered\\n children. Lieutenant Colonel Gryaznov, who passed through the village\\n of Ilica, three weeks after the massacre told us the following:\\n\\n There were thousands of dead bodies hacked to pieces, on the roads.\\n Every Armenian who happened to pass through these roads, cursed and\\n spat on the corpses. In the courtyard of a mosque which was about\\n 25x30 meter square, dead bodies were piled to a height of 140 \\n centimeters. Among these corpses were men and women of every age,\\n children and old people. The women\\'s bodies had obvious marks of\\n rape. The genitals of many girls were filled with gun-powder.\\n\\n A few educated Armenian girls, who worked as telephone operators\\n for the Armenian troops were called by Lieutenant Colonel Gryaznov\\n to the courtyard of the mosque and he bitterly told them to be \\n proud of what the Armenians had done. To the lieutenant colonel\\'s\\n disgusted amazement, the Armenian girls started to laugh and giggle,\\n instead of being horrified. The lieutenant colonel had severely\\n reprimanded those girls for their indecent behaviour. When he told\\n the girls that the Armenians, including women, were generally more\\n licentious than even the wildest animals, and that their indecent\\n and shameful laughter was the most obvious evidence of their inhumanity\\n and barbarity, before a scene that appalled even veteran soldiers,\\n the Armenian girls finally remembered their sense of shame and\\n claimed they had laughed because they were nervous.\\n\\n An Armenian contractor at the Alaca Communication zone command\\n narrated the following incident which took place on February 20:\\n\\n The Armenians had nailed a Turkish women to the wall. They had cut\\n out the women\\'s heart and placed the heart on top of her head.\\n The great massacre in Erzurum began on February 7... The enlisted men \\n of the artillery division caught and stripped 270 people. Then they\\n took these people into the bath to satisfy their lusts. 100 people\\n among this group were able to save their lives as the result of\\n my decisive attempts. The others, the Armenians claimed, were \\n released when they learnt that I understood what was going on. \\n Among those who organized this treacherous act was the envoy to the\\n Armenian officers, Karagodaviev. Today, some Turks were murdered\\n on the streets.\\n\\n On February 12, some Armenians have shot more than ten innocent\\n Moslems. The Russian soldiers who attempted to save these people were\\n threatened with death. Meanwhile I imprisoned an Armenian for\\n murdering an innocent Turk. \\n\\n When an Armenian officer told an Armenian murderer that he would \\n be hanged for his crime, the killer shouted furiously: \\'How dare\\n you hang an Armenian for killing a Turk?\\' In Erzurum, the \\n Armenians burned down the Turkish market. On February 17, I heard\\n that the entire population of Tepekoy village, situated within\\n the artillery area, had been totally annihilated. On the same \\n day when Antranik entered Erzurum, I reported the massacre to\\n him, and asked him to track down the perpetrators of this horrible\\n act. However no result was achieved.\\n\\n In the villages whose inhabitants had been massacred, there was a\\n natural silence. On the night of 26/27 February, the Armenians deceived\\n the Russians, perpetrated a massacre and escaped for fear of the \\n Turkish soldiers. Later, it was understood that this massacre had\\n been based upon a method organized and planned in a circular. \\n The population had been herded in a certain place and then killed\\n one by one. The number of murders committed on that night reached\\n three thousand. It was the Armenians who bragged to about the details\\n of the massacre. The Armenians fighting against the Turkish soldiers\\n were so few in number and so cowardly that they could not even\\n withstand the Turkish soldiers who consisted of only five hundred\\n people and two cannons, for one night, and ran away. The leading\\n Armenians of the community could have prevented this massacre.\\n However, the Armenian intellectuals had shared the same ideas with\\n the renegades in this massacre, just as in all the others. The lower\\n classes within the Armenian community have always obeyed the orders\\n of the leading Armenian figures and commanders. \\n\\n I do not like to give the impression that all Armenian intellectuals\\n were accessories to these murders. No, for there were people who\\n opposed the Armenians for such actions, since they understood that\\n it would yield no result. However, such people were only a minority.\\n Furthermore, such people were considered as traitors to the Armenian\\n cause. Some have seemingly opposed the Armenian murders but have\\n supported the massacres secretly. Some, on the other hand, preferred\\n to remain silent. There were certain others, who, when accused by\\n the Russians of infamy, would say the following: \\'You are Russians.\\n You can never understand the Armenian cause.\\' The Armenians had a\\n conscience. They would commit massacres and then would flee in fear\\n of the Turkish soldiers.\"\\n\\n\\nSerdar Argic\\n\\n                           \\'We closed the roads and mountain passes that \\n                            might serve as ways of escape for the Turks \\n                            and then proceeded in the work of extermination.\\'\\n                                                  (Ohanus Appressian - 1919)\\n                           \\'In Soviet Armenia today there no longer exists \\n                            a single Turkish soul.\\' (Sahak Melkonian - 1920)\\n\\n\\n',\n",

I do know\\nthat\\nhistorically, apostasy has very rarely been punished at all, let alone\\nby the death penalty.\\n\\nMy understanding is that Khomeini\\'s ruling was not based on the\\nlaw of apostasy (alone). It was well known that Rushdie was an apostate\\nlong before he wrote the offending novel and certainly there is no\\nprecedent in the Qur\\'an, hadith, or in Islamic history for indiscriminantly\\nlevelling death penalties for apostasy.\\n\\nI believe the charge levelled against Rushdie was that of \"fasad\". This\\nruling applies both within and outside the domain of an\\nIslamic state and it can be carried out by individuals. The reward was\\nnot offered by Khomeini but by individuals within Iran.\\n\\n\\n> Stuff deleted\\n> Also, I think you are muddying the issue as you seem to assume that\\n> Khomeini\\'s fatwa was issued due to the _distribution_ of the book.

However, the charge of \"fasad\" can encompass a\\nnumber of lesser charges. I remember that when diplomatic relations\\nbroke off between Britain and Iran over the fatwa - Iran stressed that\\nthe condemnation of the author, and the removal of the book from\\ncirculation were two preliminary conditions for resolving the\\n\"crisis\". But you are correct to point out that banning the book was not\\nthe main thrust behind the fatwa. Islamic charges such as fasad are\\nlevelled at people, not books.\\n\\nThe Rushdie situation was followed in Iran for several months before the\\nissuance of the fatwa. Rushdie went on a media blitz,\\npresenting himself as a lone knight guarding the sacred values of\\nsecular democracy and mocking the foolish concerns of people\\ncrazy enough to actually hold their religious beliefs as sacred. \\nFanning the flames and milking the controversy to boost\\nhis image and push the book, he was everywhere in the media. Then\\nMuslim demonstrators in several countries were killed while\\nprotesting against the book. Rushdie appeared momentarily\\nconcerned, then climbed back on his media horse to once again\\nattack the Muslims and defend his sacred rights. It was at this\\npoint that the fatwa on \"fasad\" was issued.\\n\\nThe fatwa was levelled at the person of Rushdie - any actions of\\nRushdie that feed the situation contribute to the legitimization of\\nthe ruling. The book remains in circulation not by some independant\\nwill of its own but by the will of the author and the publishers. The fatwa\\nagainst the person of Rushdie encompasses his actions as well. The\\ncrime was certainly a crime in progress (at many levels) and was being\\nplayed out (and played up) in the the full view of the media.\\n\\nP.S. I\\'m not sure about this but I think the charge of \"shatim\" also\\napplies to Rushdie and may be encompassed under the umbrella\\nof the \"fasad\" ruling.\\n',\n",

Societal morality is necessarily\\nvery crude and broad-brush stuff which attempts to deal with what\\nis necessary to keep that society going  - and often it\\'s a little\\nover-enthusiastic about doing so.  Individual morality is a different\\nthing, it often includes societal mores (or society is in trouble),\\nbut is stronger.

Is the point irrelevant?\\n\\nNo.  Often the answer is \"we are\".  But if society is those who make\\nthe rules, that\\'s a different question.  If society is who should\\nmake the rules, that\\'s yet another.  I don\\'t claim to have the answers, either,\\nbut I don\\'t think we do it very well in Ireland, and I like some things\\nabout the US system, at least in principle.\\n\\n#\\n#>#2)How do \"they\" define what is acceptable?\\n#\\n#>Depends.\\n#On....  Again, this comes from a certain question (see above).\\n\\nWell, ideally they don\\'t, but if they must they should do it by consensus, IMO.\\n#\\n#>#3)How do we keep from a \"whatever is legal is what is \"moral\" \"position?\\n#\\n#>By adopting a default position that people\\'s moral decisions\\n#>are none of society\\'s business,\\n#\\n#So how can we put people in jail? How can we condemn other societies?\\n\\nBecause sometimes that\\'s necessary.  The hard trick is to recognise when\\nit is, and equally importantly, when it isn\\'t.\\n\\n# and only interfering when it\\'s truly\\n#>necessary.\\n#\\n#Why would it be necessary?  What right do we have to interfere?\\n\\nIMO, it isn\\'t often that interference (i.e. jail, and force of various\\nkinds and degrees) is both necessary and effective.  Where you derive \\nthe right to interfere is a difficult question - it\\'s a sort of\\nliar\\'s paradox: \"force is necessary for freedom\".   One possible justification\\nis that people who wish to take away freedom shouldn\\'t object if\\ntheir own freedom is taken away - the paradox doesn\\'t arise if\\nwe don\\'t actively wish to take way anyone\\'s freedom.\\n#\\n#  The introduction of permissible interference causes the problem\\n#>that it can be either too much or too little - but most people seem\\n#>to agree that some level of interference is necessary.\\n#\\n#They see the need for a \"justice\" system.  How can we even define that term?\\n\\nOnly by consensus, I guess.\\n\\n#  Thus you\\n#>get a situation where \"The law often allows what honour forbids\", which I\\'ve\\n#>come to believe is as it should be.  \\n#\\n#I admit I don\\'t understand that statement.\\n\\nWhat I mean is that, while thus-and-such may be legal, thus-and-such may\\nalso be seen as immoral.

Patty Murrays.  We were there to discuss SSTO, and\\ncommercial space.  This is how it went...\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter receiving a packet containing a presentation on the benifits of SSTO,\\nI called and tried to schedule a meeting with our local Senator (D) Patty\\nMurray, Washington State.  I started asking for an hour, and when I heard\\nthe gasp on the end of the phone, I quickly backed off to 1/2 an hour.\\nLater in that conversation, I learned that a standard appointment is 15 minutes.\\n\\nWe got the standard bozo treatment.  That is, we were called back by an aide,\\nwho scheduled a meeting with us, in order to determine that we were not\\nbozos, and to familiarize himself with the material, and to screen it, to \\nmake sure that it was appropriate to take the senators time with that material.\\n\\nWell, I got allocated 1/2 hour with Sen. Murrays aide, and we ended up talking\\nto him for 45 minutes, with us ending the meeting, and him still listening.\\nWe covered a lot of ground, and only a little tiny bit was DCX specific.  \\nMost of it was a single stage reusable vehicle primer.  There was another\\nwoman there who took copius quantities of notes on EVERY topic that\\nwe brought up.\\n\\nBut, with Murray being new, we wanted to entrench ourselves as non-corporate\\naligned (I.E. not speaking for boeing) local citizens interentested in space.\\nSo, we spent a lot of time covering the benifits of lower cost access to\\nLEO.  Solar power satellites are a big focus here, so we hit them as becoming \\nfeasible with lower cost access, and we hit the environmental stand on that.\\nWe hit the tourism angle, and I left a copy of the patric Collins Tourism\\npaper, with side notes being that everyone who goes into space, and sees the\\natmosphere becomes more of an environmentalist, esp. after SEEING the smog\\nover L.A.  We hit on the benifits of studying bone decalcification (which is \\nmore pronounced in space, and said that that had POTENTIAL to lead to \\nunderstanding of, and MAYBE a cure for osteoporosis.  We hit the education \\nwhereby kids get enthused by space, but as they get older and find out that\\nthey havent a hop in hell of actually getting there, they go on to other\\nfields, with low cost to orbit, the chances they might get there someday \\nwould provide greater incentive to hit the harder classes needed.\\n\\nWe hit a little of the get nasa out of the operational launch vehicle business\\nangle.  We hit the lower cost of satellite launches, gps navigation, personal\\ncommunicators, tellecommunications, new services, etc...  Jobs provided\\nin those sectors.\\n\\nJobs provided building the thing, balance of trade improvement, etc..\\nWe mentioned that skypix would benifit from lower launch costs.\\n\\nWe left the paper on what technologies needed to be invested in in order\\nto make this even easier to do.  And he asked questions on this point.\\n\\nWe ended by telling her that we wanted her to be aware that efforts are\\nproceeding in this area, and that we want to make sure that the\\nresults from these efforts are not lost (much like condor, or majellan),\\nand most importantly, we asked that she help fund further efforts along\\nthe lines of lowering the cost to LEO.\\n\\nIn the middle we also gave a little speal about the Lunar Resource Data \\nPurchase act, and the guy filed it separately, he was VERY interested in it.\\nHe asked some questions about it, and seemed like he wanted to jump on it,\\nand contact some of the people involved with it, so something may actually\\nhappen immediatly there.\\n\\nThe last two things we did were to make sure that they knew that we\\nknew a lot of people in the space arena here in town, and that they\\ncould feel free to call us any time with questions, and if we didn't know\\nthe answers, that we would see to it that they questions got to people who\\nreally did know the answers.\\n\\nThen finally, we asked for an appointment with the senator herself.  He\\nsaid that we would get on the list, and he also said that knowing her, this\\nwould be something that she would be very interested in, although they\\ndo have a time problem getting her scheduled, since she is only in the\\nstate 1 week out of 6 these days.\\n\\nAll in all we felt like we did a pretty good job.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\tJohn.\\n\",\n",

Generally, these\\ntelegrams were issued by the Turkish Minister of the Interior, Talaat Pasha,\\nfor example, we have the following set regarding children:\\n\\n\\t\"To the Government of Aleppo.\\n\\n\\t November 5, 1915. We are informed that the little ones belonging to\\n\\t the Armenians from Sivas, Mamuret-ul-Aziz, Diarbekir and Erzeroum\\n\\t [hundreds of km distance from Aleppo] are adopted by certain Moslem\\n\\t families and received as servants when they are left alone through\\n\\t the death of their parents. We inform you that you are to collect\\n\\t all such children in your province and send them to the places of\\n\\t deportation, and also to give the necessary orders regarding this to\\n\\t the people.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMinister of the Interior,\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tTalaat\" [1]\\n\\n\\t\"To the Government of Aleppo.\\n\\n\\t September 21, 1915.

Send them away to the desert and inform us.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMinister of the Interior,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tTalaat\" [2]\\n\\n\\t\"To the General Committee for settling and deportees.\\n\\n\\t November 26, 1915.

[3]\\n\\n\\n\\t\"To the Government of Aleppo.\\n\\n\\t January 15, 1916. We hear that certain orphanages which have been\\n\\t opened receive also the children of the Armenians. Whether this is\\n\\t done through the ignorance of our real purpose, or through contempt\\n\\t of it, the Government will regard the feeding of such children or\\n\\t any attempt to prolong their lives as an act entirely opposed to it\\n\\t purpose, since it considers the survival of these children as\\n\\t detrimental. I recommend that such children shall not be received\\n\\t into the orphanages, and no attempts are to be made to establish\\n\\t special orphanages for them.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMinister of the Interior,\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tTalaat.\" [4]\\n\\n\\t\"To the Government of Aleppo.\\n\\n\\n\\t Collect and keep only those orphans who cannot remember the tortures\\n\\t to which their parents have been subjected.

It is necessary that these children should be turned\\n\\t out of your vilayet and sent with the caravans to the place of\\n\\t deportation. Those that have been kept till now are also to be sent\\n\\t away, in compliance with our previous orders, to Sivas.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMinister of the Interior,\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tTalaat\" [6]\\n\\nIn 1926, Halide Edip (a pioneer Turkish nationalist) wrote in her memoirs\\nabout a conversation with Talaat Pasha, verifying and \"rationalizing\" this\\nultra-national fascist anti-Armenian mentality, the following:\\n\\n\\t\"I have the conviction that as long as a nation does the best for\\n\\t its own interest, and succeeds, the world admires it and thinks\\n\\t it moral. I am ready to die for what I have done, and I know I\\n\\t shall die for it.\" [7]\\n\\n\\nThese telegrams were entered as unquestioned evidence during the 1923 trial of\\nTalaat Pasha\\'s, assassin, Soghomon Tehlerian. The Turkish government never\\nquestioned these \"death march orders\" until 1986, during a time when the world\\nwas again reminded of the genocide of the Armenians.\\n\\nFor reasons known to those who study the psychology of genocide denial, the\\nTurkish government and their supporters in crime deny that such orders were\\never issued, and further claim that these telegrams were forgeries based on a\\nstudy by S. Orel and S. Yuca of the Turkish Historical Society.\\n\\nIf one were to examine the sample \"authentic text\" provided in the Turkish \\nHistorical Society study and use their same forgery test on that sample, it \\ntoo would be a forgery!. In fact, if any of the tests delineated by the \\nTurkish Historical Society are performed an any piece of Ottoman Turkish or \\nPersian/Arabic script, one finds that anything handwritten in such language is\\na forgery. \\n\\nToday, the body of Talaat Pasha lies in a tomb on Liberty Hill, Istanbul,\\nTurkey, just next to the Yildiz University campus. The body of this genocide \\narchitect was returned to Turkey from Germany during WW2 when Turkey was in a \\nheightened state of proto-fascism.

Digital immortality.\\n\\nThe basic idea behind \"digital immortality\" is that computer networks   \\nare here to stay and that anything interesting you deposit on them\\nwill be around near-forever.  The GIFs and JPGs of today will be the\\nartifacts of a digital future.  Perhaps they\\'ll be put in different\\nformats, perhaps only surviving on backup tapes....but they\\'ll be\\nthere...and someone will dig them up.  \\n \\nIf that doesn\\'t interest you... OTIS also offers a forum for critique\\nand exhibition of your works....a virtual art gallery that never closes\\nand exists in an information dimension where your submissions will hang\\nas wallpaper on thousands of glowing monitors.  Suddenly, life is \\nbreathed into your work...and by merit of it\\'s stimulus, it will \\ntravel the globe on pulses of light and electrons.\\n \\nSpectators are welcome also, feel free to browse the gallery and \\nlet the artists know what you think of their efforts.  Keep your own\\ncopies of the images to look at when you\\'ve got the gumption...\\nthat\\'s what they\\'re here for.\\n\\n---------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nWHERE?             \\n\\nOTIS currently (as of 4/21/93) has two FTP sites.  \\n \\n \\t141.214.4.135 (projects/otis), the UWI site\\n\\t\\t\\n\\tsunsite.unc.edu (/pub/multimedia/pictures/OTIS), the SUNsite \\n\\t(you can also GOPHER to this site for OTIS as well)\\n\\nMerely \"anonymous FTP\" to either site on Internet and change to the\\nappropriate directory.  Don\\'t forget to get busy and use the \"bin\"\\ncommand to make sure you\\'re in binary.\\n\\nOTIS has also been spreading to some dial-up BBS systems around North\\nAmerica....the following systems have a substancial supply of\\nOTIStuff...\\n\\tUnderground Cafe (Omaha) (402.339.0179) 2 lines\\n\\tCyberDen (SanFran?) (415.472.5527)  Usenet Waffle-iron\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n \\nHOW DO YOU CONTRIBUTE?\\n              \\nWhat happens is...you draw a pretty picture or take a lovely   \\nphoto, get it scanned into an image file, then either FTP-put\\nit in the CONTRIB/Incoming directory or use UUENCODE to send it to me\\n(email addresses at eof) in email.  After the image is received,\\nit will be put into the correct directory.  Computer originated works\\nare also welcome.\\n\\nOTIS\\' directories house two types of image files, GIF and JPG.  \\nGIF and JPG files require, oddly enough, a GIF or JPG viewer to \\nsee.  These viewers are available for all types of computers at \\nmost large FTP sites around Internet.  JPG viewers are a bit\\ntougher to find.  If you can\\'t find one, but do have a GIF viewer,  \\nyou can obtain a JPG-to-GIF conversion program which will change    \\nJPG files to a standard GIF format. \\n\\nOTIS also accepts animation files.      \\n\\nWhen you submit image files, please send me email at the same time\\nstating information about what you uploaded and whether it is to be\\nused (in publications or other projects) or if it is merely for people\\nto view.  Also, include some biographical information on yourself, we\\'ll\\nbe having info-files on each contributing artist and their works.  You \\ncan also just upload a text-file of info about yourself (instead of \\nemailing).\\n\\nIf you have pictures, but no scanner, there is hope.  Merely send\\ncopies to:\\n\\nThe OTIS Project\\nc/o Ed Stastny\\nPO BX 241113\\nOmaha, NE 68124-1113\\n\\nI will either scan them myself or get them to someone who will  \\nscan them.  Include an ample SASE if you want your stuff back.  \\nAlso include information on each image, preferably a 1-3 line \\ndescription of the image that we can include in the infofile in the\\ndirectory where it\\'s finally put.  If you have preferences as to what\\nthe images are to be named, include those as well.  \\n \\nConversely, if you have a scanner and would like to help out, please\\ncontact me and we\\'ll arrange things.\\n\\nIf you want to submit your works by disk, peachy.  Merely send a 3.5\"\\ndisk to the above address (Omaha) and a SASE if you want your disk back.\\nThis is good for people who don\\'t have direct access to encoders or FTP,\\nbut do have access to a scanner.  We accept disks in either Mac or IBM\\ncompatible format.  If possible, please submit image files as GIF or\\nJPG.  If you can\\'t...we can convert from most formats...we\\'d just rather\\nnot have to.\\n\\nAt senders request, we can also fill disks with as much OTIS as they\\ncan stand.  Even if you don\\'t have stuff to contribute, you can send\\na blank disk and an SASE (or $2.50 for disk, postage and packing) to \\nget a slab-o-OTIS.\\n\\nAs of 04/21/93, we\\'re at about 18 megabytes of files, and growing.  \\nEmail me for current archive size and directory.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDISTRIBUTION?\\n\\nThe images distributed by the OTIS project may be distributed freely   \\non the condition that the original filename is kept and that it is\\nnot altered in any way (save to convert from one image format to\\nanother).  In fact, we encourage files to be distributed to local \\nbulletin boards and such.  If you could, please transport the\\nappropriate text files along with the images.  \\n \\nIt would also be nice if you\\'d send me a note when you did post images\\nfrom OTIS to your local bbs.  I just want to keep track of them so\\nparticipants can have some idea how widespread their stuff is.\\n\\nIt\\'s the purpose of OTIS to get these images spread out as much as\\npossible.  If you have the time, please upload a few to your favorite\\nBBS system....or even just post this \"info-file\" there.  It would be\\nkeen of you.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nUSE?\\n\\nIf you want to use any of the works you find on the OTIS directory,\\nyou\\'ll have to check to see if permission has been granted and the \\nstipulations of the permission (such as free copy of publication, or\\nfull address credit).  You will either find this in the \".rm\" file for    \\nthe image or series of images...or in the \"Artists\" directory under the \\nArtists name.  If permission isn\\'t explicitly given, then you\\'ll have \\nto contact the artist to ask for it.  If no info is available, email\\nme (ed@cwis.unomaha.edu), and I\\'ll get in contact with the artist for \\nyou, or give you their contact information.\\n \\nWhen you DO use permitted work, it\\'s always courteous to let the artist\\nknow about it, perhaps even send them a free copy or some such\\ncompensation for their files.\\n\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nNAMING IMAGES?\\n\\nPlease keep the names of your files in \"dos\" format.  That means, keep\\nthe filename (before .jpg or .gif) to eight characters or less.  The way\\nI usually do it is to use the initials of the artist, plus a three or\\nfour digit \"code\" for the series of images, plus the series number.\\nThus, Leonardo DeVinci\\'s fifth mechanical drawing would be something\\nlike:\\n \\n\\tldmek5.gif     OR    ldmek5.jpg    OR    ldmech5.gif   ETC\\n\\nKeeping the names under 8 characters assures that the filename will\\nremain intact on all systems.  \\n\\n\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------- \\n\\nCREATING IMAGE FILES?\\n\\nWhen creating image files, be sure to at least include your name\\nsomewhere on or below the picture.  This gives people a reference in\\ncase they\\'d like to contact you.  You may also want to include a title,\\naddress or other information you\\'d like people to know.\\n\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nHMMM?!\\n\\nThat\\'s about it for now.  More \"guidelines\" will be added as needed.\\nYour input is expected.\\n\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDISCLAIMER:  The OTIS Project has no connection to the Church of OTIS  \\n \\t     (a sumerian deity) or it\\'s followers, be they pope, priest,\\n\\t     or ezine administrator.  We do take sacrifices and donations\\n\\t     however.\\n\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDISCLAIMER:  The OTIS Project is here for the distribution of original \\n \\t     image files.  The files will go to the public at large.  \\n\\t     It\\'s possible, as with any form of mass-media, that someone\\n\\t     could unscrupulously use your images for financial gain.  \\n    \\t     Unless you\\'ve given permission for that, it\\'s illegal.  OTIS\\n\\t     takes no responsibility for this.  In simple terms, all rights\\n\\t     revert to the author/artist.  To leave an image on OTIS is to \\n\\t     give permission for it to be viewed, copied and distributed \\n\\t     electronically.  If you don\\'t want your images distributed     \\n\\t     all-over, don\\'t upload them.  To leave an image on OTIS is\\n\\t     NOT giving permission to have it used in any publication or\\n\\t     broadcast that incurs profit (this includes, but is not \\n\\t     limited to, magazines, newsletters, clip-art software,        \\n\\t     screen-printed clothing, etc).  You must give specific\\n\\t     permission for this sort of usage.  \\n\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRemember, the operative term is \"stimulate\".

The people of \\nTurkiye know quite well that Greece and the Greek Cypriots will never \\nabandon the idea of hellenizing Cyprus and will remain eternally \\nhopeful of uniting it with Greece, someday, whatever the cost to the\\nparties involved. The history speaks for itself. Greece was the sole \\nperpetrator of invasion on that island when it sent its troops on July \\n15, 1974 in an attempt to topple the legitimate government of Archibishop \\nMakarios.\\n\\nFollowing the Greek Cypriot attempt to annex the island to Greece with \\nthe aid of the Greek army, Turkiye intervened by using her legal right \\ngiven by two international agreements. Turkiye did it for the frequently \\nand conveniently forgotten people of the island, Turkish Cypriots. For \\nthose Turkish Cypriots whose grandparents have been living on the island \\nsince 1571. \\n\\nThe release of Nikos Sampson, a member of EOKA [National Organization\\nof Cypriot Fighters] and a convicted terrorist, shows that the\\n\\'enosis\\' mentality continues to survive in Greece.

Dr.  Nihat Ilhan happened to  be on duty that  night, the\\n24th   December  1963.

The onslaught  of the\\nGreeks against the Turks, which  started three days ago, has been\\ngoing on  with all its  ferocity; and defenseless women,  old men\\nand children are being brutally  killed by Greeks. And now Kumsal\\nArea of Nicosia witnesses the  worst example of the Greeks savage\\nbloodshed...\\n\\nThe wife  and the  three infant  children of  Dr. Nihat  Ilhan, a\\nmajor on duty at the camp  of the Cyprus Turkish Army Contingent,\\nare  mercilessly and  dastardly  shot dead  while  hiding in  the\\nbathroom of their house, by  maddened Greeks who broke into their\\nhome. A glaring example of Greek barbarism.\\n\\nLet us  now listen to the  relating of the said  incident told by\\nMr. Hasan  Yusuf Gudum, an  eye witness, who himself  was wounded\\nduring the same terrible event.\\n\\n\"On the night of the 24th  of December, 1963 my wife Feride Hasan\\nand I were paying a visit to the family of Major Dr. Nihat Ilhan.\\nOur neighbours  Mrs. Ayshe of  Mora, her daughter Ishin  and Mrs.\\nAyshe\\'s  sister Novber  were also  with us.  We were  all sitting\\nhaving supper.  All of  a sudden bullets  from the  Pedieos River\\ndirection started to riddle the  house, sounding like heavy rain.\\nThinking  that   the  dining-room  where  we   were  sitting  was\\ndangerous, we  ran to  the bathroom and  toilet which  we thought\\nwould be  safer. Altogether we were  nine persons. We all  hid in\\nthe bathroom  except my wife  who took  refuge in the  toilet. We\\nwaited in fear. Mrs. Ilhan the wife of Major Doctor, was standing\\nin the bath with her three children Murat, Kutsi and Hakan in her\\narms. Suddenly with  a great noise we heard the  front door open.\\nGreeks had  come in and were  combing, every corner of  the house\\nwith  their machine  gun bullets.  During these  moments I  heard\\nvoices saying, in  Greek, \"You want Taksim eh!\"  and then bullets\\nstarted flying in the bathroom. Mrs. Ilhan and her three children\\nfell into  the bath. They were  shot. At this moment  the Greeks,\\nwho broke  into the bathroom, emptied  their guns on us  again. I\\nheard one of the Major\\'s children moan, then I fainted.\\n\\nWhen I came  to myself 2 or  3 hours later, I saw  Mrs. Ilhan and\\nher three children lying dead in the  bath. I and the rest of the\\nneighbours in the  bathroom were all seriously  wounded. But what\\nhad happened to my wife? Then I remembered and immediately ran to\\nthe  toilet, where,  in  the doorway,  I saw  her  body. She  was\\nbrutally murdered.\\n\\nIn the  street admist the  sound of  shots I heard  voices crying\\n\"Help, help. Is  there no one to save us?\"  I became terrified. I\\nthought that  if the Greeks came  again and found that  I was not\\ndead they would kill  me. So I ran to the  bedroom and hid myself\\nunder the double-bed.\\n\\nAn our  passed by. In the  distance I could still  hear shots. My\\nmouth was dry,  so I came out  from under the bed  and drank some\\nwater. Then I put  some sweets in my pocket and  went back to the\\nbathroom, which was exactly as I had left in an hour ago. There I\\noffered sweets  to Mrs. Ayshe,  her daughter and Mrs.  Novber who\\nwere all wounded.\\n\\nWe  waited in  the bathroom  until 5  o\\'clock in  the morning.  I\\nthought morning would never come.  We were all wounded and needed\\nto be taken  to hospital. Finally, as we could  walk, Mrs. Novber\\nand I, went  out into the street hoping to  find help, and walked\\nas far as Koshklu Chiftlik.\\n\\nThere, we met  some people who took us to  hospital where we were\\noperated on. When  I regained my consciousness I  said that there\\nwere more  wounded in the  house and  they went and  brought Mrs.\\nAyshe and her daughter.\\n\\nAfter staying three  days in the hospital I was  sent by plane to\\nAnkara  for  further treatment.  There  I  have had  four  months\\ntreatment but still I cannot use  my arm.

An impressive amount of\\nevidence suggests that introns are of very ancient origin; it is\\nlikely that early exons represented early protein domains.\\n\\nIs the number of introns decreasing or increasing? It appears that\\nintron loss can occur, and species with common ancestry usually\\nhave quite similar exon-intron structure in their genes. \\n\\nOn the other hand, the possibility that introns have been inserted\\nlater, presents several logical difficulties. Introns are removed\\nby a splicing mechanism - this would have to be present, but unused,\\nif introns are inserted. Moreover, intron insertion would have\\nrequired _precise_ targeting - random insertion would not be tolerated,\\nsince sequences for intron removal (self-splicing of mRNA) are\\nconserved. Besides, transposition of a sequence usually leaves a\\ntrace - long terminal repeats and target - site duplications, and\\nthese are not found in or near intron sequences. \\n\\nI seriously recommend reading textbooks on molecular biology and\\ngenetics before posting \"theological arguments\" like this. \\nTry Watson\\'s Molecular Biology of the Gene or Darnell, Lodish\\n& Baltimore\\'s Molecular Biology of the Cell for starters.\\n\\n: Remember, the question was posed in a theological context (Why does\\n: God cause disease in newborns?), and my answer is likewise from a\\n: theological perspective -- my own.  It is no less valid than a purely\\n: scientific perspective, just different.\\n\\nScientific perspective is supported by the evidence, whereas \\ntheological perspectives often fail to fulfil this criterion.\\n \\n: I think you misread my meaning.

Would you please cite a few references that support\\nyour assertion? Your assertion is less valid than the scientific\\nperspective, unless you support it by some evidence.\\n\\nIn fact, it has been claimed that parasites and diseases are perhaps\\nmore important than we\\'ve thought - for instance, sex might\\nhave evolved as defence against parasites. (This view is supported by\\ncomputer simulations of evolution, eg Tierra.) \\n \\n: Perhaps.  I thought it was higher energy rays like X-rays, gamma\\n: rays, and cosmic rays that caused most of the damage.\\n\\nIn fact, it is thermal energy that does most of the damage, although\\nit is usually mild and easily fixed by enzymatic action. \\n\\n: Actually, neither of us \"knows\" what the atmosphere was like at the\\n: time when God created life.  According to my recollection, most\\n: biologists do not claim that life began 4 billion years ago -- after\\n: all, that would only be a half billion years or so after the earth\\n: was created.  It would still be too primitive to support life.  I\\n: seem to remember a figure more like 2.5 to 3 billion years ago for\\n: the origination of life on earth.  Anyone with a better estimate?\\n\\nI\\'d replace \"created\" with \"formed\", since there is no need to \\ninvoke any creator if the Earth can be formed without one.\\nMost recent estimates of the age of the Earth range between 4.6 - 4.8\\nbillion years, and earliest signs of life (not true fossils, but\\norganic, stromatolite-like layers) date back to 3.5 billion years.\\nThis would leave more than billion years for the first cells to\\nevolve.\\n\\nI\\'m sorry I can\\'t give any references, this is based on the course\\non evolutionary biochemistry I attended here. \\n\\n: >>dominion, it was no great feat for Satan to genetically engineer\\n: >>diseases, both bacterial/viral and genetic.

The younger Arens, a research scientist at the University of\\nSouthern California, said the ADL kept a file on him in the 1980s presumably\\nbecause he has criticized Israel\\'s treatment of Palestinians.\\n   \"The ADL believes that anyone who is an Arab American ... or speaks\\npolitically against Israel is at least a closet anti-Semite,\" Arens said.\\n   The ADL has denied any wrongdoing, but couldn\\'t comment on the lawsuit\\nbecause it hasn\\'t reviewed it, said a spokesman at the ADL\\'s New York\\nheadquarters.\\n   The FBI and local police and prosecutors are investigating allegations that\\nthe ADL spied on thousands of individuals and hundreds of groups, including\\nwhite supremacist and anti-Semitic organizations, Arab-Americans, Greenpeace,\\nthe National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and San Francisco\\npublic television station KQED.\\n   Some information allegedly came from confidential police and government\\nrecords, according to court documents filed in the probe and the civil lawsuit.\\nNo charges have been filed in the criminal investigation.\\n   The lawsuit accuses the ADL of violating California\\'s privacy law, which\\nforbids the intentional disclosure of personal information \"not otherwise\\npublic\" from state or federal records.\\n   The lawsuit claims the ADL disclosed the information to \"persons and\\nentities\" who had no compelling need to receive it.

The Lezghis have weekly newspapers and some elementary \\nschool classes in their language.\\n\\nAutonomy is a different question.

Equipped with large-area wide-wavelength (1-20\\n    Angstrom) X-ray telescope, X-ray CCD cameras, and imaging gas\\n    scintillation proportional counters.\\n\\n\\n    CASSINI - Saturn orbiter and Titan atmosphere probe. Cassini is a joint\\n    NASA/ESA project designed to accomplish an exploration of the Saturnian\\n    system with its Cassini Saturn Orbiter and Huygens Titan Probe. Cassini\\n    is scheduled for launch aboard a Titan IV/Centaur in October of 1997.\\n    After gravity assists of Venus, Earth and Jupiter in a VVEJGA\\n    trajectory, the spacecraft will arrive at Saturn in June of 2004. Upon\\n    arrival, the Cassini spacecraft performs several maneuvers to achieve an\\n    orbit around Saturn. Near the end of this initial orbit, the Huygens\\n    Probe separates from the Orbiter and descends through the atmosphere of\\n    Titan. The Orbiter relays the Probe data to Earth for about 3 hours\\n    while the Probe enters and traverses the cloudy atmosphere to the\\n    surface. After the completion of the Probe mission, the Orbiter\\n    continues touring the Saturnian system for three and a half years. Titan\\n    synchronous orbit trajectories will allow about 35 flybys of Titan and\\n    targeted flybys of Iapetus, Dione and Enceladus. The objectives of the\\n    mission are threefold: conduct detailed studies of Saturn\\'s atmosphere,\\n    rings and magnetosphere; conduct close-up studies of Saturn\\'s\\n    satellites, and characterize Titan\\'s atmosphere and surface.\\n\\n    One of the most intriguing aspects of Titan is the possibility that its\\n    surface may be covered in part with lakes of liquid hydrocarbons that\\n    result from photochemical processes in its upper atmosphere. These\\n    hydrocarbons condense to form a global smog layer and eventually rain\\n    down onto the surface. The Cassini orbiter will use onboard radar to\\n    peer through Titan\\'s clouds and determine if there is liquid on the\\n    surface. Experiments aboard both the orbiter and the entry probe will\\n    investigate the chemical processes that produce this unique atmosphere.\\n\\n    The Cassini mission is named for Jean Dominique Cassini (1625-1712), the\\n    first director of the Paris Observatory, who discovered several of\\n    Saturn\\'s satellites and the major division in its rings. The Titan\\n    atmospheric entry probe is named for the Dutch physicist Christiaan\\n    Huygens (1629-1695), who discovered Titan and first described the true\\n    nature of Saturn\\'s rings.\\n\\n\\t Key Scheduled Dates for the Cassini Mission (VVEJGA Trajectory)\\n\\t -------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\t   10/06/97 - Titan IV/Centaur Launch\\n\\t   04/21/98 - Venus 1 Gravity Assist\\n\\t   06/20/99 - Venus 2 Gravity Assist\\n\\t   08/16/99 - Earth Gravity Assist\\n\\t   12/30/00 - Jupiter Gravity Assist\\n\\t   06/25/04 - Saturn Arrival\\n\\t   01/09/05 - Titan Probe Release\\n\\t   01/30/05 - Titan Probe Entry\\n\\t   06/25/08 - End of Primary Mission\\n\\t    (Schedule last updated 7/22/92)\\n\\n\\n    GALILEO - Jupiter orbiter and atmosphere probe, in transit.

The primary objective of the\\n    TOPEX/POSEIDON project is to make precise and accurate global\\n    observations of the sea level for several years, substantially\\n    increasing understanding of global ocean dynamics. The satellite also\\n    will increase understanding of how heat is transported in the ocean.\\n\\n\\n    ULYSSES- European Space Agency probe to study the Sun from an orbit over\\n    its poles. Launched in late 1990, it carries particles-and-fields\\n    experiments (such as magnetometer, ion and electron collectors for\\n    various energy ranges, plasma wave radio receivers, etc.) but no camera.\\n\\n    Since no human-built rocket is hefty enough to send Ulysses far out of\\n    the ecliptic plane, it went to Jupiter instead, and stole energy from\\n    that planet by sliding over Jupiter\\'s north pole in a gravity-assist\\n    manuver in February 1992. This bent its path into a solar orbit tilted\\n    about 85 degrees to the ecliptic. It will pass over the Sun\\'s south pole\\n    in the summer of 1993. Its aphelion is 5.2 AU, and, surprisingly, its\\n    perihelion is about 1.5 AU-- that\\'s right, a solar-studies spacecraft\\n    that\\'s always further from the Sun than the Earth is!\\n\\n    While in Jupiter\\'s neigborhood, Ulysses studied the magnetic and\\n    radiation environment. For a short summary of these results, see\\n    *Science*, V. 257, p. 1487-1489 (11 September 1992). For gory technical\\n    detail, see the many articles in the same issue.\\n\\n\\n    OTHER SPACE SCIENCE MISSIONS (note: this is based on a posting by Ron\\n    Baalke in 11/89, with ISAS/NASDA information contributed by Yoshiro\\n    Yamada (yamada@yscvax.ysc.go.jp).

I think the usual answer would be no -- in which case, the\\npart saying \"For them has God prepared forgiveness and a great reward\"\\nsays they have souls.  \\n\\n(If it makes sense to say that things without souls can be forgiven, then \\nI have no idea _what_ a soul is.)\\n\\nAs for your saying that the quote above may not be given a high priority\\nin all interpretations, any thinking approach to the Qur\\'an has to give\\nall verses of the Qur\\'an equal priority.  That is because, according to\\nMuslim belief, the _whole_ Qur\\'an is the revelation of God -- in fact,\\ndenying the truth of any part of the Qur\\'an is sufficient to be\\nconsidered a disbeliever in Islam.\\n\\n>Quite similar to you other post, even when the Quran does not encourage\\n>slavery, it is not justified to say that iit forbids or puts an end to\\n>slavery. It is a non sequitur.\\n\\nLook, any approach to the Qur\\'an must be done with intelligence and\\nthought.  It is in this fashion that one can try to understand the\\nQuran\\'s message.  In a book of finite length, it cannot explicitly\\nanswer every question you want to put to it, but through its teachings\\nit can guide you.  I think, however, that women are the spiritual equals\\nof men is clearly and unambiguously implied in the above verse, and that\\nsince women can clearly be \"forgiven\" and \"rewarded\" they _must_ have\\nsouls (from the above verse).\\n\\nLet\\'s try to understand what the Qur\\'an is trying to teach, rather than\\ntry to see how many ways it can be misinterpreted by ignoring this\\npassage or that passage.  The misinterpretations of the Qur\\'an based on\\nignoring this verse or that verse are infinite, but the interpretations \\nfully consistent are more limited.  Let\\'s try to discuss these\\ninterpretations consistent with the text rather than how people can\\nignore this bit or that bit, for that is just showing how people can try\\nto twist Islam for their own ends -- something I do not deny -- but\\nprovides no reflection on the true teachings of Islam whatsoever.\\n\\n Fred Rice\\n darice@yoyo.cc.monash.edu.au   \\n',\n",
       "  'From: nstramer@supergas.dazixco.ingr.com (Naftaly Stramer)\\nSubject: THE HAMAS WAY of DEATH\\nNntp-Posting-Host: supergas\\nReply-To: nstramer@dazixco.ingr.com\\nOrganization: Intergraph Electronics\\nLines: 104\\n\\n\\n                     THE HAMAS WAY of DEATH\\n \\n     (Following is a transcript of a recruitment and training\\nvideotape made last summer by the Qassam Battalions, the military\\narm of Hamas, an Islamic Palestinian group. Hamas figures\\nsignificantly in the Middle East equation. In December, Israel\\ndeported more than 400 Palestinians to Lebanon in response to\\nHamas\\'s kidnapping and execution of an Israeli soldier. A longer\\nversion appears in the May issue of Harper\\'s Magazine, which\\nobtained and translated the tape.)\\n \\n     My name is Yasir Hammad al-Hassan Ali. I live in Nuseirat [a\\nrefugee camp in the Gaza Strip]. I was born in 1964. I finished\\nhigh school, then attended Gaza Polytechnic. Later, I went to work\\nfor Islamic University in Gaza as a clerk. I\\'m married and I have\\ntwo daughters.\\n     The Qassam Battalions are the only group in Palestine\\nexplicitly dedicated to jihad [holy war]. Our primary concern is\\nPalestinians who collaborate with the enemy. Many young men and\\nwomen have fallen prey to the cunning traps laid by the [Israeli]\\nSecurity Services.\\n     Since our enemies are trying to obliterate our nation,\\ncooperation with them is clearly a terrible crime. Our most\\nimportant objective must be to put an end to the plague of\\ncollaboration. To do so, we abduct collaborators, intimidate and\\ninterrogate them in order to uncover other collaborators and expose\\nthe methods that the enemy uses to lure Palestinians into\\ncollaboration in the first place. In addition to that, naturally,\\nwe confront the problem of collaborators by executing them.\\n     We don\\'t execute every collaborator. After all, about 70\\npercent of them are innocent victims, tricked or black-mailed into\\ntheir misdeeds. The decision whether to execute a collaborator is\\nbased on the seriousness of his crimes. If, like many\\ncollaborators, he has been recruited as an agent of the Israeli\\nBorder Guard then it is imperative that he be executed at once.\\nHe\\'s as dangerous as an Israeli soldier, so we treat him like an\\nIsraeli soldier.\\n     There\\'s another group of collaborators who perform an even\\nmore loathsome role -- the ones who help the enemy trap young men\\nand women in blackmail schemes that force them to become\\ncollaborators. I regard the \"isqat\" [the process by which a\\nPalestinians is blackmailed into collaboration] of single person as\\ngreater crime than the killing of a demonstrator. If someone is\\nguilty of causing repeated cases of isqat, than it is our religious\\nduty to execute him.\\n     A third group of collaborators is responsible for the\\ndistribution of narcotics. They work on direct orders from the\\nSecurity Services to distribute drugs as widely as possible. Their\\nvictims become addicted and soon find it unbearable to quit and\\nimpossible to afford more. They collaborate in order to get the\\ndrugs they crave. The dealers must also be executed.\\n     In the battalions, we have developed a very careful method of\\nuncovering collaborators, We can\\'t afford to abduct an innocent\\nperson, because once we seize a person his reputation is tarnished\\nforever. We will abduct and interrogate a collaborator only after\\nevidence of his guilt has been established -- never before. If\\nafter interrogation the collaborator is found guilty beyond any\\ndoubt, then he is executed.\\n     In many cases, we don\\'t have to make our evidence against\\ncollaborators public, because everyone knows that they\\'re guilty.\\nBut when the public isn\\'t aware that a certain individual is a\\ncollaborator, and we accuse him, people are bound to ask for\\nevidence. Many people will proclaim his innocence, so there must be\\nirrefutable proof before he is executed. This proof is usually\\nobtained in the form of a confession.\\n     At first, every collaborator denies his crimes. So we start\\noff by showing the collaborator the testimony against him. We tell\\nhim that he still has a chance to serve his people, even in the\\nlast moment of his life, by confessing and giving us the\\ninformation we need.\\n     We say that we know his repentance in sincere and that he has\\nbeen a victim. That kind of talk is convincing. Most of them\\nconfess after that. Others hold out; in those cases, we apply\\npressure, both psychological and physical. Then the holdouts\\nconfess as well.\\n     Only one collaborator has ever been executed without an\\ninterrogation. In that case, the collaborator had been seen working\\nfor the Border Guard since before the intifada, and he himself\\nconfessed his involvement to a friend, who disclosed the\\ninformation to us. In addition, three members of his network of\\ncollaborators told us that he had caused their isqat. With this\\nmuch evidence, there was no need to interrogate him. But we are\\nvery careful to avoid wrongful executions. In every case, our\\nprincipal is the same: the accused should be interrogated until he\\nhimself confesses his crimes. \\n     A few weeks ago, we sat down and complied a list of\\ncollaborators to decide whether there were any who could be\\nexecuted without interrogation. An although we had hundreds of\\nnames, still, because of our fear of God and of hell, we could not\\nmark any of these men, except for the one I just mentioned, for\\nexecution.\\n     When we execute a collaborator in public, we use a gun. But\\nafter we abduct and interrogate a collaborator, we can\\'t shoot him\\n-- to do so might give away our locations. That\\'s why collaborators\\nare strangled. Sometimes we ask the collaborator, \"What do you\\nthink? How should we execute you?\" One collaborator told us,\\n\"Strangle me.\" He hated the sight of blood.\\n\\n-----\\nNaftaly Stramer \\t\\t\\t | Intergraph Electronics\\nInternet: nstramer@dazixco.ingr.com      | 6101 Lookout Road, Suite A    \\nVoice: (303)581-2370  FAX: (303)581-9972 | Boulder, CO 80301\\n\"Quality is everybody\\'s job, and it\\'s everybody\\'s job to watch all that they can.\"\\n',\n",

However, expressing\\n    complex notions such as God and infinity or a seemingly well\\n    defined concept such as a flower can present challenges which far\\n    exceed their technical skills.\\n\\n    The explosive use of computers as visualization and expression\\n    tools has compounded this problem.  In hypermedia, multimedia and\\n    virtual reality systems vast amounts of information confront the\\n    observer or participant.  Wading through a multitude of\\n    simultaneous images and sounds in possibly unfamiliar\\n    representions, a confounded user asks: \"What does it all mean?\"\\n\\n    Since image construction, transmission, reception, decipherment and\\n    ultimate understanding are complex tasks, strongly influenced by\\n    physiology, education and culture; and, since electronic media\\n    radically amplify each processing step, then we, as electronic\\n    communicators, must determine the fundamental paradigms for\\n    composing imagery for understanding.\\n\\n    Therefore, the purpose of this conference is to bring together a\\n    breadth of disciplines, including, but not limited to, the\\n    physical, biological and computational sciences, technology, art,\\n    psychology, philosophy, and education, in order to define and\\n    discuss the issues essential to image understanding within the\\n    computer graphics context.\\n\\n\\n    FEATURED SPEAKERS INCLUDE:\\n\\n        Psychology/Perception:\\n            Marc De May, University of Ghent\\n            Beverly J.

I walked by, and they were showing real-time video capture\\nusing a (Radious or SuperMac?) card to digitize and make right on the spot\\nquicktime movies.  I think the quicktime they were using was the old one\\n(1.5).\\n\\n   They digitized a guy talking there in 160x2xx something.  It played back quite\\nnicely and in real time.  The guy then expanded the window (resized) to 25x by\\n3xx (320 in y I think) and the frame rate decreased enough to notice that it\\nwasn't 30fps (or about 30fps) anymore.  It dropped to like 15 fps.  Then he\\nincreased it just a bit more, and it dropped to 10<->12 fps. \\n\\n   Then I asked him what Mac he was using... He was using a Quadra (don't know\\nwhat model, 900?) to do it, and he was telling the guys there that the Quicktime\\ncould play back at the same speed even on an LCII.\\n\\n   Well, I spoiled his claim so to say, since a 68040 Quadra Mac was having\\na little bit of trouble.  And this wasn't even from the hardisk!  This was\\nfrom memory!\\n\\n   Could it be that you saw either a newer version of quicktime, or some\\nhardware assisted Centris, or another software product running the \\nanimation (like supposedly MacroMind's Accelerator?)?\\n\\n   Don't misunderstand me, I just want to clarify this.\\n\\n   But for the sake of the posting about a computer doing it or not, I can\\nclaim 320x200 (a tad more with overscan) being done in 256,000+ colors in \\nmy computer (not from the hardisk) at 30fps with Scala MM210.\\n\\n   But I agree, if we consider MPEG stuff, I think a multimedia consumer\\nlow-priced box has a lot of market...

It has a density of 0.058 lb/cu in,\\ntherefore the theoretical height for a constant section column\\nthat can just support itself is 4.8 million inches, or 400,000 ft,\\nor 75 Statute miles.\\n\\nNow, a real structure will have horizontal bracing (either a truss\\ntype, or guy wires, or both) and will be used below the crush strength.\\nLet us assume that we will operate at 40% of the theoretical \\nstrength.  This gives a working height of 30 miles for a constant\\nsection column.  \\n\\nA constant section column is not the limit on how high you can\\nbuild something if you allow a tapering of the cross section\\nas you go up.  For example, let us say you have a 280,000 pound\\nload to support at the top of the tower (for simplicity in\\ncalculation).  This requires 2.5 square inches of column cross\\nsectional area to support the weight.  The mile of structure\\nbelow the payload will itself weigh 9,200 lb, so at 1 mile \\nbelow the payload, the total load is now 289,200 lb, a 3.3% increase.\\n\\nThe next mile of structure must be 3.3% thicker in cross section\\nto support the top mile of tower plus the payload.  Each mile\\nof structure must increase in area by the same ratio all the way\\nto the bottom.  We can see from this that there is no theoretical\\nlimit on area, although there will be practical limits based\\non how much composites we can afford to by at $40/lb, and how\\nmuch load you need to support on the ground (for which you need\\na foundation that the bedrock can support.\\n\\nLet us arbitrarily choose $1 billion as the limit in costruction\\ncost.  With this we can afford perhaps 10,000,000 lb of composites,\\nassuming our finished structure costs $100/lb.  The $40/lb figure\\nis just for materials cost.  Then we have a tower/payload mass\\nratio of 35.7:1.  At a 3.3% mass ratio per mile, the tower\\nheight becomes 111 miles.  This is clearly above the significant\\natmosphere.  A rocket launched from the top of the tower will still\\nhave to provide orbital velocity, but atmospheric drag and g-losses\\nwill be almost eliminated.  G-losses are the component of\\nrocket thrust in the vertical direction to counter gravity,\\nbut which do not contribute to horizontal orbital velocity.  Thus\\nthey represent wasted thrust.  Together with drag, rockets starting\\nfrom the ground have a 15% velocity penalty to contend with.\\n\\nThis analysis is simplified, in that it does not consider wind\\nloads.  These will require more structural support over the first\\n15 miles of height.  Above that, the air pressure drops to a low\\nenough value for it not to be a big factor.\\n\\nDani Eder\\n\\n-- \\nDani Eder/Meridian Investment Company/(205)464-2697(w)/232-7467(h)/\\nRt.1, Box 188-2, Athens AL 35611/Location: 34deg 37' N 86deg 43' W +100m alt.\\n\",\n",

The Earth, by\\nlatest estimates, is about 4.6 billion years old, and has had life for\\nabout 3.5 billion of those years. Humans have only been around for (at\\nmost) about 200,000 years. But, the fossil evidence inidcates that life\\nhas been changing and evolving, and, in fact, disease-ridden, long before\\nthere were people.

Heck, not just\\nfossil evidence, but what we\\'ve been able to glean from genetic study shows\\nthat disease has been around for a long, long time. If human sin was what\\nbrought about disease (at least, indirectly, though necessarily) then\\nhow could it exist before humans?\\n\\n>                             God created the original genetic code\\n>perfect and without flaw.

Only a very small percentage of microlife is\\nharmful to humans... and that small percentage seems to be reasonalby\\nconstant in size, but the ranks keep changing. For example, bubonic\\nplague used to be a really nasty disease, I\\'m sure you\\'ll agree. But\\nit still pops up from time to time, even today... and doesn\\'t do as\\nmuch damage. Part of that is because of better sanitation, but even\\nwhen people get the disease, the symptoms tend to be less severe than in\\nthe past. This seems to be partly because people who were very susceptible\\ndied off long ago, and because the really nasty variants \\'overgrazed\\',\\n(forgive the poor terminology, I\\'m an engineer, not a doctor! :-> ) and\\ndied off for lack of nearby hosts.\\n I could be wrong on this, but from what I gather acne is only a few\\nhundred years old, and used to be nastier, though no killer.

I have a question. Humans were created perfect, right?\\nAnd, you admit that we have an inbuilt abiliy to fight off disease. It\\nseems unlikely that Satan, who\\'s making the diseases, would also gift\\nhumans with the means to fight them off. Simpler to make the diseases less\\nlethal, if he wants survivors. As far as I can see, our immune systems,\\nimperfect though they may (presently?) be, must have been built into us\\nby God. I want to be clear on this: are you saying that God was planning\\nahead for the time when Satan would be in charge by building an immune\\nsystem that was not, at the time of design, necessary? That is, God made\\nour immune systems ahead of time, knowing that Adam and Eve would sin and\\ntheir descendents would need to fight off diseases?\\n\\n>This may be more of a mystical/supernatural explanation than you\\n>are prepared to accept, but God is not responsible for disease.\\n>Even if Satan had nothing to do with the original inception of\\n>disease, evolution by random chance would have produced them since\\n>humanity forsook God\\'s protection.\\n\\n Here\\'s another puzzle. What, exactly, do you mean by \\'perfect\\' in the\\nphrase, \\'created... perfect and without flaw\\'? To my mind, a \\'perfect\\'\\nsystem would be incapable of degrading over time. A \\'perfect\\' system\\nthat will, without constant intervention, become imperfect is *not* a\\nperfect system.

That is, the\\noriginal genetic \\'instructions\\' were perfect, but were \\'written\\' in\\ninferior materials that had to be carefully tended or would fall apart?\\nIf so, why could God not have used better materials?\\n Was God *incapable* of creating a system that could maintain itself,\\nof did It just choose not to?\\n\\n[deletions]\\n>In summary, newborns are innocent, but God does not cause their suffering.\\n\\n My main point, as I said, was that there really isn\\'t any evidence for\\nthe explanation you give.

I\\'ve typed it in verbatim, for you\\nfolks to chew over. Many of the topics recently\\ndiscussed on sci.space are covered in this.\\n\\nGibbons Outlines Space Station Redesign Guidance\\n\\nDr. John H. Gibbons, Director, Office of Science and\\nTechnology Policy, outlined to the members-designate of\\nthe Advisory Committee on the Redesign of the Space\\nStation on April 3, three budget options as guidance to\\nthe committee in their deliberations on the redesign of\\nthe space station.\\n\\nA low option of $5 billion, a mid-range option of $7\\nbillion and a high option of $9 billion will be\\nconsidered by the committee. Each option would cover\\nthe total expenditures for space station from fiscal\\nyear 1994 through 1998 and would include funds for\\ndevelopment, operations, utilization, Shuttle\\nintegration, facilities, research operations support,\\ntransition cost and also must include adequate program\\nreserves to insure program implementation within the\\navailable funds.\\n\\nOver the next 5 years, $4 billion is reserved within\\nthe NASA budget for the President\\'s new technology\\ninvestment. As a result, station options above $7\\nbillion must be accompanied by offsetting reductions in\\nthe rest of the NASA budget.  For example, a space\\nstation option of $9 billion would require $2 billion\\nin offsets from the NASA budget over the next 5 years.\\n\\nGibbons presented the information at an organizational\\nsession of the advisory committee. Generally, the\\nmembers-designate focused upon administrative topics\\nand used the session to get acquainted. They also\\nreceived a legal and ethics briefing and an orientation\\non the process the Station Redesign Team is following\\nto develop options for the advisory committee to\\nconsider.\\n\\nGibbons also announced that the United States and its\\ninternational partners -- the Europeans, Japanese, and\\nCanadians -- have decided, after consultation, to give\\n\"full consideration\" to use of Russian assets in the\\ncourse of the space station redesign process.\\n\\nTo that end, the Russians will be asked to participate\\nin the redesign effort on an as-needed consulting\\nbasis, so that the redesign team can make use of their\\nexpertise in assessing the capabilities of MIR and the\\npossible use of MIR and other Russian capabilities and\\nsystems. The U.S. and international partners hope to\\nbenefit from the expertise of the Russian participants\\nin assessing Russian systems and technology. The\\noverall goal of the redesign effort is to develop\\noptions for reducing station costs while preserving key\\nresearch and exploration capabilities. Careful\\nintegration of Russian assets could be a key factor in\\nachieving that goal.\\n\\nGibbons reiterated that, \"President Clinton is\\ncommitted to the redesigned space station and to making\\nevery effort to preserve the science, the technology\\nand the jobs that the space station program represents.\\nHowever, he also is committed to a space station that\\nis well managed and one that does not consume the\\nnational resources which should be used to invest in\\nthe future of this industry and this nation.\"\\n\\nNASA Administrator Daniel S.

Both the \"External Tank\" and\\n\"Wingless Orbiter\" options have been deleted from the SSF redesign\\noptions list. Today\\'s (4/23) edition of the New York Times reports\\nthat O\\'Connor told the panel that some redesign proposals have\\nbeen dropped, such as using the \"giant external fuel tanks used\\nin launching space shuttles,\" and building a \"station around\\nan existing space shuttle with its wings and tail removed.\"\\n\\nCurrently, there are three options being considered, as presented\\nto the advisory panel meeting yesterday (and as reported in\\ntoday\\'s Times).\\n\\nOption \"A\" - Low Cost Modular Approach\\nThis option is being studied by a team from MSFC. {As an aside,\\nthere are SSF redesign teams at MSFC, JSC, and LaRC supporting\\nthe SRT (Station Redesign Team) in Crystal City. Both LeRC and\\nReston folks are also on-site at these locations, helping the respective\\nteams with their redesign activities.} Key features of this\\noption are:\\n  -  Uses \"Bus-1\", a modular bus developed by Lockheed that\\'s\\n     qualified for STS and ELV\\'s. The bus provides propulsion, GN&C\\n     Communications, & Data Management. Lockheed developed this\\n     for the Air Force.\\n  -  A \"Power Station Capability\" is obtained in 3 Shuttle Flights.\\n     SSF Solar arrays are used to provide 20 kW of power. The vehicle\\n     flies in an \"arrow mode\" to optimize the microgravity environment.\\n     Shuttle/Spacelab missions would utilize the vehilce as a power\\n     source for 30 day missions.\\n  -  Human tended capability (as opposed to the old SSF sexist term\\n     of man-tended capability) is achieved by the addition of the\\n     US Common module. This is a modified version of the existing\\n     SSF Lab module (docking ports are added for the International\\n     Partners\\' labs, taking the place of the nodes on SSF). The\\n     Shuttle can be docked to the station for 60 day missions.\\n     The Orbiter would provide crew habitability & EVA capability.\\n  -  International Human Tended. Add the NASDA & ESA modules, and\\n     add another 20 kW of power\\n  -  Permanent Human Presence Capability. Add a 3rd power module,\\n     the U.S. habitation module, and an ACRV (Assured Crew Return\\n     Vehicle).\\n\\nOption \"B\" - Space Station Freedom Derived\\nThe Option \"B\" team is based at LaRC, and is lead by Mike Griffin.\\nThis option looks alot like the existing SSF design, which we\\nhave all come to know and love :)\\n\\nThis option assumes a lightweight external tank is available for\\nuse on all SSF assembly flights (so does option \"A\"). Also, the \\nnumber of flights is computed for a 51.6 inclination orbit,\\nfor both options \"A\" and \"B\".\\n\\nThe build-up occurs in six phases:\\n  -  Initial Research Capability reached after 3 flights. Power\\n     is transferred from the vehicle to the Orbiter/Spacelab, when\\n     it visits.\\n  -  Man-Tended Capability (Griffin has not yet adopted non-sexist\\n     language) is achieved after 8 flights. The U.S. Lab is\\n     deployed, and 1 solar power module provides 20 kW of power.\\n  -  Permanent Human Presence Capability occurs after 10 flights, by\\n     keeping one Orbiter on-orbit to use as an ACRV (so sometimes\\n     there would be two Orbiters on-orbit - the ACRV, and the\\n     second one that comes up for Logistics & Re-supply).\\n  -  A \"Two Fault Tolerance Capability\" is achieved after 14 flights,\\n     with the addition of a 2nd power module, another thermal\\n     control system radiator, and more propulsion modules.\\n  -  After 20 flights, the Internationals are on-board. More power,\\n     the Habitation module, and an ACRV are added to finish the\\n     assembly in 24 flights.\\n\\nMost of the systems currently on SSF are used as-is in this option, \\nwith the exception of the data management system, which has major\\nchanges.\\n\\nOption C - Single Core Launch Station.\\nThis is the JSC lead option. Basically, you take a 23 ft diameter\\ncylinder that\\'s 92 ft long, slap 3 Space Shuttle Main Engines on\\nthe backside, put a nose cone on the top, attached it to a \\nregular shuttle external tank and a regular set of solid rocket\\nmotors, and launch the can. Some key features are:\\n  - Complete end-to-end ground integration and checkout\\n  - 4 tangentially mounted fixed solar panels\\n  - body mounted radiators (which adds protection against\\n    micrometeroid & orbital debris)\\n  - 2 centerline docking ports (one on each end)\\n  - 7 berthing ports\\n  - a single pressurized volume, approximately 26,000 cubic feet\\n    (twice the volume of skylab).\\n  - 7 floors, center passageway between floors\\n  - 10 kW of housekeeping power\\n  - graceful degradation with failures (8 power channels, 4 thermal\\n    loops, dual environmental control & life support system)\\n  - increased crew time for utilization\\n  - 1 micro-g thru out the core module\\n',\n",

Remember from stellar evolution that \\nblack holes and neutron stars(pulsars) are formed from high mass stars,\\nM(star)=1.4M(sun).  High mass stars live fast and burn hard, taking\\nappoximately 10^5-10^7 years before going nova, or supernova.  In this time,\\nthey don\\'t live long enough to get perturbed out of the galactic plane, so any\\nof these (if assumed to be the sources of GRB\\'s) will be in the plane of the\\ngalaxy.  \\n        Then we take the catalog of bursts that have been recieved from the\\nvarious satellites around the solar system, (Pioneer Venus has one, either\\nPion. 10 or 11, GINGA, and of course BATSE) and we do distribution tests on our\\ncatalog.  These tests all  show, that the bursts have an isotropic\\ndistribution(evenly spread out in a radial direction), and they show signs of\\nhomogeneity, i.e. they do not clump in any one direction.  So, unless we are\\nsampling the area inside the disk of the galaxy, we are sampling the UNIVERSE.\\nNot cool, if you want to figure out what the hell caused these things.  Now, I\\nsuppose you are saying, \"Well, we stil only may be sampling from inside the\\ndisk.\"  Well, not necessarily.  Remember, we have what is more or less an\\ninterplanetary network of burst detectors with a baseline that goes waaaay out\\nto beyond Pluto(pioneer 11), so we should be able, with all of our detectors de\\ntect some sort of difference in angle from satellite to satellite.  Here\\'s an \\nanalogy:  You see a plane overhead.  You measure the angle of the plane from\\nthe origin of your arbitrary coordinate system.  One of your friends a mile\\naway sees the same plane, and measures the angle from the zero point of his\\narbitrary system, which is the same as yours.  The two angles are different,\\nand you should be able to triangulate the position of your burst, and maybe\\nfind a source.  To my knowledge, no one has been able to do this.  \\n        I should throw in why halo, and corona models don\\'t work, also.  As I\\nsaid before, looking at the possible astrophysics of the bursts, (short\\ntimescales, high energy) black holes, and pulsars exhibit much of this type of\\nbehavior.  If this is the case, as I said before, these stars seem to be bound\\nto the disk of the galaxy, especially the most energetic of the these sources.\\nWhen you look at a simulated model, where the bursts are confined to the disk,\\nbut you sample out to large distances, say 750 mpc, you should definitely see\\nnot only an anisotropy towards you in all direction, but a clumping of sources \\nin the direction of the  galactic center.  As I said before, there is none of\\nthese characteristics.  \\n        \\n        I think that\\'s all of it...if someone needs clarification, or knows\\nsomething that I don\\'t know, by all means correct me.  I had the honor of\\ntaking the Bursts class with the person who has done the modeling of these\\ndifferent distributions, so we pretty much kicked around every possible\\ndistribution there was, and some VERY outrageous sources. Colliding pulsars,\\nblack holes, pulsars that are slowing down...stuff like that.

There many people alive today who were born in \\n>a city called Konstantinoupolis. \\n\\nI know it doesn't make sense, but since when is 'Napoleon' about\\nsense, anyway? Further striking bigoted and racist attitude of \\ncertain Greeks still exists in our day. Most Greeks insist even \\ntoday, that the 537 year-old capital of the Ottoman Empire should \\nbe called not by its rightful name of Istanbul, but by its half \\na millennium-old moniker 'Cons*(whatever).'\\n\\nEveryone knows that New York City was once called 'New Amsterdam'\\nbut Dutch people do not persist on calling it that today. The name \\nof Stalingrad too is long gone, replaced by Volgagrad. China's\\nPeking traded its name for Beiging long ago. Ciudad Trujillo\\nof the Dominican Republic is now Santa Domingo. Zimbabve's\\nold colonial capital Salisburry became Harrare. These changes\\nhave all been accepted officially by everyone in the world.\\n\\nBut, Greeks are still determined on calling the Turkish Istanbul \\nby the name of 'Cons*.'\\n\\nHow can one explain this total intransigence? What makes Greeks\\nso different from other mortals? 18-year-old questionable\\ndemocracy? Why don't they seem to reconcile with the fact,\\nfor instance, that Istanbul changed hands 537 years ago in\\n1453 AD, and that this predates the discovery of the New \\nWorld, by 39 years. The declaration of U.S. independence\\nin 1776 will come 284 years later.\\n\\nShouldn't then, half a millennium be considered enough time for \\n'Cons*' to be called a Turkish city? Where is the logic in the \\nGreek reasoning, if there is any? How long can one sit on the \\nlaurels of an ancient civilization? Ancient Greece does not exist, \\nany more than any other 16 civilizations that existed on the soil \\nof Anatolia.\\n\\nThese undereducated 'wieneramus' live with an illusion. It \\nis the same mentality which allows them to rationalize\\nthat Cyprus is a Greek Island. No history book shows\\nthat it ever was. It belonged to the Ottoman Turks 'lock,\\nstock and barrel' for a period of well over 300 years.\\n\\nIn fact, prior to the Turks' acquisition of it, following\\nbloody naval battles with the Venetians in 1570 AD, the\\nisland of Cyprus belonged, invariably, to several nations:\\n\\nThe Assyrians, the Sumerians, the Phoenicians, the Egyptians,\\nthe Ottoman Turks, of course in that order, owned it as \\ntheir territory. But, it has never been the possession\\nof the government of Greece - not even for one day -\\nin the history of the world. Moreover, Cyprus is\\nlocated 1500 miles from the Greek mainland, but only \\n40 miles from Turkiye's southern coastline.\\n\\nSaddam Hussein claims that Kuwait was once Iraqi\\nterritory and the Greek Cypriot government and \\nthe terrorist Greek governments think that Cyprus\\nalso was once part of the Greek hegemony.\\n\\nThose 'Arromdians' involved in this grandiose hallucination\\nshould wake up from their sweet daydreams and confront \\nreality. Again, wishful thinking is unproductive, only \\nfacts count.\\n\\nAs for Selanik,\\n\\n  <<Those Jews who survived these assaults in Southeastern Europe fled\\n  particularly to Salonica, whose Jewish population increased substantially\\n  as a result, from 28,000 in 1876 to 90,000 in 1908, more than half the\\n  total population, though even there increased persecution by local Greeks\\n  led many Jews to flee elsewhere in the Ottoman Empire, particularly to\\n  the great port of Izmir.\\n\\n  Despite all the pressure from Ottomans and foreign Jews alike, the ritual\\n  murders and other assaults by Christians on Jews went on and on. Greek\\n  efforts to decimate the Jewish population of Salonica culminated in 1912\\n  and 1913, following Greek conquest of Salonica during the first Balkan War,\\n  when many of its Jews, were either killed or terrorized into leaving...>>\\n\\n  <<Though Greece was obligated by the post World War I treaties to allow\\n  Jews and other minorities to use their own languages in education and to\\n  practice their religions without hindrance, a law was issued in 1923\\n  which forbad all inhabitants from working on Sunday, stimulating a new\\n  Jewish exodus as it was intended to do. Between 1932 and 1934 there was a\\n  series of anti-Semitic riots in Salonica, with the Cambel quarter, where\\n  most of the remaining Jews lived, being burned to the ground. This\\n  was followed by regulations requiring the use of Greek and prohibiting\\n  Hebrew and Judea-Spanish in the Jewish schools. A start was made also\\n  on expropriating the land of the principal Jewish cemetery in Salonica\\n  for use by the new University in order to derive the Jews out [47]. By\\n  killing and driving out large numbers of Jews, the Greeks left a\\n  substantial Greek majority in the city for the first time, and starting\\n  Salonica Jewry on the way to its final decimation by the Nazis during the\\n  occupation of Greece starting in 1941.\\n\\n  Salonica and Izmir of course were not the only places of refuge for\\n  Jewish refugees entering the Empire during its last century of existence.\\n  Istanbul, Edirne, and other parts of Rumelia and Anatolia received\\n  thousands more. Nor were Jews the only refugees received and helped by\\n  the government of the Sultan. Thousands of Muslims accompanied them in\\n  flight from similar persecutions wherever Balkan christian states gained\\n  independence or expanded. The Russian conquest of the Crimea and the\\n  Caucasus starting in the late eighteenth century, and particularly during\\n  and after the Crimean War, combined with the same independence movements\\n  in Southeastern Europe that had caused so much suffering and flight among\\n  its Jews caused thousands of helpless, ill, and poverty-stricken Muslim\\n  refugees to accompany them into the ever shrinking boundaries of the\\n  Ottoman Empire, with the Istanbul government struggling mightly but vainly\\n  to house and feed them as best it could. From 1850 to 1864 as many as\\n  800,000 Crimean Tatars, Circassians, and other Muslims from north and\\n  east of the Black Sea had entered Anatolia alone, as many as 200,000 more\\n  came during the next twenty years, while 474,389 refugees entered in 1876-\\n  1877 as a result of the Ottoman wars with Russia and the Balkan states,\\n  with an equal number gaining refuge in the European portions of the\\n  Empire.>>\\n\\n[47] Robert Mantran, 'La structure sociale de la communaute juive de\\n  Salonqiue a la fin du dix-neuvieme siecle', RH no.534 (1980), 391-92;\\n  Nehama VII, 762; Joseph Nehama (Salonica) to AIU (Paris) no.2868/2,\\n  12 May 1903 (AIU Archives I-C-43); and no.2775, 10 January 1900 (AIU\\n  Archives I-C-41), describing daily battles between Jewish and Greek\\n  children in the streets of Salonica.

I would prefer a method that would do this in as little\\n>  time as possible.  I need this for use in a forward raytracing\\n>  program.\\n\\nI think that this is a very difficult problem.  To start with, lines and\\npolygons are semi-algebraic sets which both contain uncountable number of\\npoints.  Here are a few off-the-cuff ideas.\\n\\nFirst, we need to check if the line and the polygon are separated.  Now, the\\nJordan curve separation theorem says that the polygon divides the plane into\\nexactly two open (and thus non-compact) regions.  Thus, the line lies\\ncompletely inside the polygon, the line lies completely outside the polygon,\\nor possibly (but this will rarely happen) the line intersects the polyon.\\n\\nNow, the phrasing of this question says \"if a line intersects a polygon\", so\\nthis is a decision problem.  One possibility (the decision model approach) is\\nto reduce the question to some other (well known) problem Q, and then try to\\nsolve Q.  An answer to Q gives an answer to the original decision problem.\\n\\nIn recent years, many geometric problems have been successfully modeled in a\\nnew language called PostScript.  (See \"PostScript Language\", by Adobe Systems\\nIncorporated, ISBN # 0-201-10179-3, co. 1985).\\n\\nSo, given a line L and a polygon P, we can write a PostScript program that\\ndraws the line L and the polygon P, and then \"outputs\" the answer.  By\\n\"output\", we mean the program executes a command called \"showpage\", which\\nactually prints a page of paper containing the line and the polygon.  A quick\\nexamination of the paper provides an answer to the reduced problem Q, and thus\\nthe original problem.\\n\\nThere are two small problems with this approach. \\n\\n\\t(1) There is an infinite number of ways to encode L and P into the\\n\\treduced problem Q.  So, we will be forced to invoke the Axiom of\\n\\tChoice (or equivalently, Zorn\\'s Lemma).  But the use of the Axiom of\\n\\tChoice is not regarded in a very serious light these days.\\n\\n\\t(2) More importantly, the question arises as to whether or not the\\n\\tPostScript program Q will actually output a piece of paper; or in\\n\\tother words, will it halt?\\n\\n\\tNow, PostScript is expressive enough to encode everything that a\\n\\tTuring Machine might do; thus the halting problem (for PostScript) is\\n\\tundecidable.  It is quite possible that the original problem will turn\\n\\tout to be undecidable.\\n\\n\\nI won\\'t even begin to go into other difficulties, such as aliasing, finite\\nprecision and running out of ink, paper or both.\\n\\nA couple of references might be:\\n\\n1.

By the well known\\nDobbin-Dullman reduction (see J. Dullman & D. Dobbin, J. Comp. Obfusc.\\n37,ii:  pp. 33-947, lemma 17(a)) line-polygon intersection can be reduced to\\nHamiltonian Circuit, without(!) the use of Grobner bases, so LPI (to coin an\\nacronym) is probably only NP-complete.

This is a pretty broad \\n interest group. Individuals have a variety of backgrounds: motojournalism, \\n roadracing from the perspective of pit crew and racers, engineering,\\n motosports enthusiasts.\\n\\n The size of the list grows weekly. We are currently at a little\\n over one hundred and eighty-five members, with contributors from\\n New Zealand, Australia, Germany, France, England, Canada\\n Finland, Switzerland, and the United States.\\n\\n The list was formed (October 1991) in response to a perceived need \\n to both provide technical discussion of riding at the edge of \\n performance (roadracing) and to improve on the very low signal-to-noise \\n ratio found in rec.motorcycles. Anyone is free to join.\\n\\n Discussion is necessarily limited by the rules of the list to \\n issues related to racing motorcycles and is to be \"flame-free\".  \\n\\n HOW TO GET THE DAILY DISTRIBUTION\\n ---------------------------------\\n\\n You are welcome to subscribe. To subscribe send your request to:\\n\\n\\n        race-request@boogie.EBay.Sun.COM\\n\\n\\n Traffic currently runs between five and twenty-five messages per day\\n (depending on the topic). \\n\\n   NB: Please do _not_ send your subscription request to the\\n       list directly.\\n \\n After you have contacted the list administrator, you will receive\\n an RSVP request.

The request is generated in\\n order to insure that there is a valid mail pathway to your site.\\n \\n Upon receipt of your RSVP, you will be added to either the daily\\n or digest distribution (as per your initial request).\\n\\n HOW TO GET THE DIGEST DISTRIBUTION\\n ----------------------------------\\n\\n It is possible to receive the list in \\'digest\\'ed form (ie. a\\n single email message). The RoadRacing Digest is mailed out \\n whenever it contains enough interesting content. Given the\\n frequency of postings this appears to be about every other\\n day.\\n\\n Should you wish to receive the list via digest (once every \\n 30-40K or so), please send a subscription request to:\\n\\n\\n        digest-request@boogie.EBay.Sun.COM\\n\\n\\n HOW TO POST TO THE LIST\\n -----------------------\\n\\n This is an open forum.

If you want to see it\\n (though this isn\\'t necessarily a guarantee that it went out)\\n you can include a \"metoo\" line in your .mailrc file (on UNIX\\n based mail systems). \\n\\n BOUNCES\\n -------\\n\\n Because I haven\\'t had the time (or the inclination to replace\\n the list distribution mechanism) we still have a problem with\\n bounces returning to the poster of a message. Occasionally,\\n sites or users go off-line (either leaving their place of\\n employment prematurely or hardware problems) and you will receive\\n bounces from the race list.

One of our tenders carrying a loud speaker was stationed\\nat the entrance to the village and it exhorted in Arabic all women,\\nchildren and aged to leave their houses and to take shelter on the\\nslopes of the hill.  By giving this humane warning our fighters threw\\naway the element of complete surprise, and thus increased their own\\nrisk in the ensuing battle. A substantial number of the inhabitants\\nobeyed the warning and they were unhurt. A few did not leave their\\nstone houses - perhaps because of the confusion. The fire of the enemy\\nwas murderous - to which the number of our casualties bears eloquent\\ntestimony. Our men were compelled to fight for every house; to\\novercome the enemy they used large numbers of hand grenades. And the\\ncivilians who had disregarded our warnings suffered inevitable\\ncasualties.\\n\\n    \"The education which we gave our soldiers throughout the years of\\nrevolt was based on the observance of the traditional laws of war. We\\nnever broke them unless the enemy first did so and thus forced us, in\\naccordance with the accepted custom of war, to apply reprisals. I am\\nconvinced, too, that our officers and men wished to avoid a single\\nunnecessary casualty in the Dir Yassin battle. But those who throw\\nstones of denunciation at the conquerors of Dir Yassin [1] would do\\nwell not to don the cloak of hypocrisy [2].\\n\\n    \"In connection with the capture of Dir Yassin the Jewish Agency\\nfound it necessary to send a letter of apology to Abdullah, whom Mr.\\nBen Gurion, at a moment of great political emotion, called \\'the wise\\nruler who seeks the good of his people and this country.\\' The \\'wise\\nruler,\\' whose mercenary forces demolished Gush Etzion and flung the\\nbodies of its heroic defenders to birds of prey, replied with feudal\\nsuperciliousness. He rejected the apology and replied that the Jews\\nwere all to blame and that he did not believe in the existence of\\n\\'dissidents.\\' Throughout the Arab world and the world at large a wave\\nof lying propaganda was let loose about \\'Jewish attrocities.\\'\\n\\n    \"The enemy propaganda was designed to besmirch our name. In the\\nresult it helped us. Panic overwhelmed the Arabs of Eretz Israel.\\nKolonia village, which had previously repulsed every attack of the\\nHaganah, was evacuated overnight and fell without further fighting.\\nBeit-Iksa was also evacuated. These two places overlooked the main\\nroad; and their fall, together with the capture of Kastel by the\\nHaganah, made it possible to keep open the road to Jerusalem. In the\\nrest of the country, too, the Arabs began to flee in terror, even\\nbefore they clashed with Jewish forces. Not what happened at Dir\\nYassin, but what was invented about Dir Yassin, helped to carve the\\nway to our decisive victories on the battlefield. The legend of Dir\\nYassin helped us in particular in the saving of Tiberias and the\\nconquest of Haifa.\"\\n\\n\\n[1] (A footnote from _The Revolt_, pp.226-7.) \"To counteract the loss\\nof Dir yassin, a village of strategic importance, Arab headquarters at\\nRamallah broadcast a crude atrocity story, alleging a massacre by\\nIrgun troops of women and children in the village. Certain Jewish\\nofficials, fearing the Irgun men as political rivals, seized upon this\\nArab gruel propaganda to smear the Irgun. An eminent Rabbi was induced\\nto reprimand the Irgun before he had time to sift the truth. Out of\\nevil, however, good came. This Arab propaganda spread a legend of\\nterror amongst Arabs and Arab troops, who were seized with panic at\\nthe mention of Irgun soldiers. The legend was worth half a dozen\\nbattalions to the forces of Israel. The `Dir Yassin Massacre\\' lie\\nis still propagated by Jew-haters all over the world.\"\\n\\n[2] In reference to denunciation of Dir Yassin by fellow Jews.\\n',\n",

Whilst I\\nhave tried to be as neutral as possible regarding contentious issues, you\\nshould always remember that this document represents only one viewpoint.  I\\nwould encourage you to read widely and draw your own conclusions; some\\nrelevant books are listed in a companion article.\\n\\nTo provide a sense of cohesion and progression, I have presented this article\\nas an imaginary conversation between an atheist and a theist.  All the\\nquestions asked by the imaginary theist are questions which have been cropped\\nup repeatedly on alt.atheism since the newsgroup was created.  Some other\\nfrequently asked questions are answered in a companion article.\\n\\nPlease note that this article is arguably slanted towards answering questions\\nposed from a Christian viewpoint.  This is because the FAQ files reflect\\nquestions which have actually been asked, and it is predominantly Christians\\nwho proselytize on alt.atheism.\\n\\nSo when I talk of religion, I am talking primarily about religions such as\\nChristianity, Judaism and Islam, which involve some sort of superhuman divine\\nbeing.  Much of the discussion will apply to other religions, but some of it\\nmay not.\\n\\n\"What is atheism?\"\\n\\nAtheism is characterized by an absence of belief in the existence of God.\\nSome atheists go further, and believe that God does not exist.  The former is\\noften referred to as the \"weak atheist\" position, and the latter as \"strong\\natheism\".\\n\\nIt is important to note the difference between these two positions.  \"Weak\\natheism\" is simple scepticism; disbelief in the existence of God.  \"Strong\\natheism\" is a positive belief that God does not exist.  Please do not\\nfall into the trap of assuming that all atheists are \"strong atheists\".\\n\\nSome atheists believe in the non-existence of all Gods; others limit their\\natheism to specific Gods, such as the Christian God, rather than making\\nflat-out denials.\\n\\n\"But isn\\'t disbelieving in God the same thing as believing he doesn\\'t exist?\"\\n\\nDefinitely not.  Disbelief in a proposition means that one does not believe\\nit to be true.  Not believing that something is true is not equivalent to\\nbelieving that it is false; one may simply have no idea whether it is true or\\nnot.  Which brings us to agnosticism.\\n\\n\"What is agnosticism then?\"\\n\\nThe term \\'agnosticism\\' was coined by Professor Huxley at a meeting of the\\nMetaphysical Society in 1876.  He defined an agnostic as someone who\\ndisclaimed (\"strong\") atheism and believed that the ultimate origin of things\\nmust be some cause unknown and unknowable.\\n\\nThus an agnostic is someone who believes that we do not and cannot know for\\nsure whether God exists.\\n\\nWords are slippery things, and language is inexact.  Beware of assuming that\\nyou can work out someone\\'s philosophical point of view simply from the fact\\nthat she calls herself an atheist or an agnostic.  For example, many people\\nuse agnosticism to mean \"weak atheism\", and use the word \"atheism\" only when\\nreferring to \"strong atheism\".\\n\\nBeware also that because the word \"atheist\" has so many shades of meaning, it\\nis very difficult to generalize about atheists.  About all you can say for\\nsure is that atheists don\\'t believe in God.  For example, it certainly isn\\'t\\nthe case that all atheists believe that science is the best way to find out\\nabout the universe.\\n\\n\"So what is the philosophical justification or basis for atheism?\"\\n\\nThere are many philosophical justifications for atheism.  To find out why a\\nparticular person chooses to be an atheist, it\\'s best to ask her.\\n\\nMany atheists feel that the idea of God as presented by the major religions\\nis essentially self-contradictory, and that it is logically impossible that\\nsuch a God could exist.  Others are atheists through scepticism, because they\\nsee no evidence that God exists.\\n\\n\"But isn\\'t it impossible to prove the non-existence of something?\"\\n\\nThere are many counter-examples to such a statement.  For example, it is\\nquite simple to prove that there does not exist a prime number larger than\\nall other prime numbers.  Of course, this deals with well-defined objects\\nobeying well-defined rules.  Whether Gods or universes are similarly\\nwell-defined is a matter for debate.\\n\\nHowever, assuming for the moment that the existence of a God is not provably\\nimpossible, there are still subtle reasons for assuming the non-existence of\\nGod.  If we assume that something does not exist, it is always possible to\\nshow that this assumption is invalid by finding a single counter-example.\\n\\nIf on the other hand we assume that something does exist, and if the thing in\\nquestion is not provably impossible, showing that the assumption is invalid\\nmay require an exhaustive search of all possible places where such a thing\\nmight be found, to show that it isn\\'t there.  Such an exhaustive search is\\noften impractical or impossible.  There is no such problem with largest\\nprimes, because we can prove that they don\\'t exist.\\n\\nTherefore it is generally accepted that we must assume things do not exist\\nunless we have evidence that they do.  Even theists follow this rule most of\\nthe time; they don\\'t believe in unicorns, even though they can\\'t conclusively\\nprove that no unicorns exist anywhere.\\n\\nTo assume that God exists is to make an assumption which probably cannot be\\ntested.  We cannot make an exhaustive search of everywhere God might be to\\nprove that he doesn\\'t exist anywhere.  So the sceptical atheist assumes by\\ndefault that God does not exist, since that is an assumption we can test.\\n\\nThose who profess strong atheism usually do not claim that no sort of God\\nexists; instead, they generally restrict their claims so as to cover\\nvarieties of God described by followers of various religions.  So whilst it\\nmay be impossible to prove conclusively that no God exists, it may be\\npossible to prove that (say) a God as described by a particular religious\\nbook does not exist.  It may even be possible to prove that no God described\\nby any present-day religion exists.\\n\\nIn practice, believing that no God described by any religion exists is very\\nclose to believing that no God exists.  However, it is sufficiently different\\nthat counter-arguments based on the impossibility of disproving every kind of\\nGod are not really applicable.\\n\\n\"But what if God is essentially non-detectable?\"\\n\\nIf God interacts with our universe in any way, the effects of his interaction\\nmust be measurable.  Hence his interaction with our universe must be\\ndetectable.\\n\\nIf God is essentially non-detectable, it must therefore be the case that he\\ndoes not interact with our universe in any way.  Many atheists would argue\\nthat if God does not interact with our universe at all, it is of no\\nimportance whether he exists or not.\\n\\nIf the Bible is to be believed, God was easily detectable by the Israelites.\\nSurely he should still be detectable today?\\n\\nNote that I am not demanding that God interact in a scientifically\\nverifiable, physical way.  It must surely be possible to perceive some\\neffect caused by his presence, though; otherwise, how can I distinguish him\\nfrom all the other things that don\\'t exist?\\n\\n\"OK, you may think there\\'s a philosophical justification for atheism, but\\n isn\\'t it still a religious belief?\"\\n\\nOne of the most common pastimes in philosophical discussion is \"the\\nredefinition game\".  The cynical view of this game is as follows:\\n\\nPerson A begins by making a contentious statement.  When person B points out\\nthat it can\\'t be true, person A gradually re-defines the words he used in the\\nstatement until he arrives at something person B is prepared to accept.  He\\nthen records the statement, along with the fact that person B has agreed to\\nit, and continues.  Eventually A uses the statement as an \"agreed fact\", but\\nuses his original definitions of all the words in it rather than the obscure\\nredefinitions originally needed to get B to agree to it.  Rather than be seen\\nto be apparently inconsistent, B will tend to play along.\\n\\nThe point of this digression is that the answer to the question \"Isn\\'t\\natheism a religious belief?\" depends crucially upon what is meant by\\n\"religious\".  \"Religion\" is generally characterized by belief in a superhuman\\ncontrolling power -- especially in some sort of God -- and by faith and\\nworship.\\n\\n[ It\\'s worth pointing out in passing that some varieties of Buddhism are not\\n  \"religion\" according to such a definition. ]\\n\\nAtheism is certainly not a belief in any sort of superhuman power, nor is it\\ncategorized by worship in any meaningful sense.  Widening the definition of\\n\"religious\" to encompass atheism tends to result in many other aspects of\\nhuman behaviour suddenly becoming classed as \"religious\" as well -- such as\\nscience, politics, and watching TV.\\n\\n\"OK, so it\\'s not a religion.  But surely belief in atheism (or science) is\\n still just an act of faith, like religion is?\"\\n\\nFirstly, it\\'s not entirely clear that sceptical atheism is something one\\nactually believes in.\\n\\nSecondly, it is necessary to adopt a number of core beliefs or assumptions to\\nmake some sort of sense out of the sensory data we experience.  Most atheists\\ntry to adopt as few core beliefs as possible; and even those are subject to\\nquestioning if experience throws them into doubt.\\n\\nScience has a number of core assumptions.  For example, it is generally\\nassumed that the laws of physics are the same for all observers.  These are\\nthe sort of core assumptions atheists make.  If such basic ideas are called\\n\"acts of faith\", then almost everything we know must be said to be based on\\nacts of faith, and the term loses its meaning.\\n\\nFaith is more often used to refer to complete, certain belief in something.\\nAccording to such a definition, atheism and science are certainly not acts of\\nfaith.  Of course, individual atheists or scientists can be as dogmatic as\\nreligious followers when claiming that something is \"certain\".  This is not a\\ngeneral tendency, however; there are many atheists who would be reluctant to\\nstate with certainty that the universe exists.\\n\\nFaith is also used to refer to belief without supporting evidence or proof.\\nSceptical atheism certainly doesn\\'t fit that definition, as sceptical atheism\\nhas no beliefs.  Strong atheism is closer, but still doesn\\'t really match, as\\neven the most dogmatic atheist will tend to refer to experimental data (or\\nthe lack of it) when asserting that God does not exist.\\n\\n\"If atheism is not religious, surely it\\'s anti-religious?\"\\n\\nIt is an unfortunate human tendency to label everyone as either \"for\" or\\n\"against\", \"friend\" or \"enemy\".  The truth is not so clear-cut.\\n\\nAtheism is the position that runs logically counter to theism; in that sense,\\nit can be said to be \"anti-religion\".  However, when religious believers\\nspeak of atheists being \"anti-religious\" they usually mean that the atheists\\nhave some sort of antipathy or hatred towards theists.\\n\\nThis categorization of atheists as hostile towards religion is quite unfair.\\nAtheist attitudes towards theists in fact cover a broad spectrum.\\n\\nMost atheists take a \"live and let live\" attitude.  Unless questioned, they\\nwill not usually mention their atheism, except perhaps to close friends.  Of\\ncourse, this may be in part because atheism is not \"socially acceptable\" in\\nmany countries.\\n\\nA few atheists are quite anti-religious, and may even try to \"convert\" others\\nwhen possible.  Historically, such anti-religious atheists have made little\\nimpact on society outside the Eastern Bloc countries.\\n\\n(To digress slightly: the Soviet Union was originally dedicated to separation\\nof church and state, just like the USA.  Soviet citizens were legally free to\\nworship as they wished.  The institution of \"state atheism\" came about when\\nStalin took control of the Soviet Union and tried to destroy the churches in\\norder to gain complete power over the population.)\\n\\nSome atheists are quite vocal about their beliefs, but only where they see\\nreligion encroaching on matters which are not its business -- for example,\\nthe government of the USA.  Such individuals are usually concerned that\\nchurch and state should remain separate.\\n\\n\"But if you don\\'t allow religion to have a say in the running of the state,\\n surely that\\'s the same as state atheism?\"\\n\\nThe principle of the separation of church and state is that the state shall\\nnot legislate concerning matters of religious belief.  In particular, it\\nmeans not only that the state cannot promote one religion at the expense of\\nanother, but also that it cannot promote any belief which is religious in\\nnature.\\n\\nReligions can still have a say in discussion of purely secular matters.  For\\nexample, religious believers have historically been responsible for\\nencouraging many political reforms.  Even today, many organizations\\ncampaigning for an increase in spending on foreign aid are founded as\\nreligious campaigns.  So long as they campaign concerning secular matters,\\nand so long as they do not discriminate on religious grounds, most atheists\\nare quite happy to see them have their say.\\n\\n\"What about prayer in schools? If there\\'s no God, why do you care if people\\n pray?\"\\n\\nBecause people who do pray are voters and lawmakers, and tend to do things\\nthat those who don\\'t pray can\\'t just ignore.  Also, Christian prayer in\\nschools is intimidating to non-Christians, even if they are told that they\\nneed not join in.  The diversity of religious and non-religious belief means\\nthat it is impossible to formulate a meaningful prayer that will be\\nacceptable to all those present at any public event.\\n\\nAlso, non-prayers tend to have friends and family who pray.  It is reasonable\\nto care about friends and family wasting their time, even without other\\nmotives.\\n\\n\"You mentioned Christians who campaign for increased foreign aid.  What about\\n atheists?  Why aren\\'t there any atheist charities or hospitals?  Don\\'t\\n atheists object to the religious charities?\"\\n\\nThere are many charities without religious purpose that atheists can\\ncontribute to.  Some atheists contribute to religious charities as well, for\\nthe sake of the practical good they do.  Some atheists even do voluntary work\\nfor charities founded on a theistic basis.\\n\\nMost atheists seem to feel that atheism isn\\'t worth shouting about in\\nconnection with charity.  To them, atheism is just a simple, obvious everyday\\nmatter, and so is charity.  Many feel that it\\'s somewhat cheap, not to say\\nself-righteous, to use simple charity as an excuse to plug a particular set\\nof religious beliefs.\\n\\nTo \"weak\" atheists, building a hospital to say \"I do not believe in God\" is a\\nrather strange idea; it\\'s rather like holding a party to say \"Today is not my\\nbirthday\".  Why the fuss?  Atheism is rarely evangelical.\\n\\n\"You said atheism isn\\'t anti-religious.  But is it perhaps a backlash against\\n one\\'s upbringing, a way of rebelling?\"\\n\\nPerhaps it is, for some.  But many people have parents who do not attempt to\\nforce any religious (or atheist) ideas upon them, and many of those people\\nchoose to call themselves atheists.\\n\\nIt\\'s also doubtless the case that some religious people chose religion as a\\nbacklash against an atheist upbringing, as a way of being different.  On the\\nother hand, many people choose religion as a way of conforming to the\\nexpectations of others.\\n\\nOn the whole, we can\\'t conclude much about whether atheism or religion are\\nbacklash or conformism; although in general, people have a tendency to go\\nalong with a group rather than act or think independently.\\n\\n\"How do atheists differ from religious people?\"\\n\\nThey don\\'t believe in God.  That\\'s all there is to it.\\n\\nAtheists may listen to heavy metal -- backwards, even -- or they may prefer a\\nVerdi Requiem, even if they know the words.  They may wear Hawaiian shirts,\\nthey may dress all in black, they may even wear orange robes.  (Many\\nBuddhists lack a belief in any sort of God.)  Some atheists even carry a copy\\nof the Bible around -- for arguing against, of course!\\n\\nWhoever you are, the chances are you have met several atheists without\\nrealising it.  Atheists are usually unexceptional in behaviour and\\nappearance.\\n\\n\"Unexceptional? But aren\\'t atheists less moral than religious people?\"\\n\\nThat depends.  If you define morality as obedience to God, then of course\\natheists are less moral as they don\\'t obey any God.  But usually when one\\ntalks of morality, one talks of what is acceptable (\"right\") and unacceptable\\n(\"wrong\") behaviour within society.\\n\\nHumans are social animals, and to be maximally successful they must\\nco-operate with each other.  This is a good enough reason to discourage most\\natheists from \"anti-social\" or \"immoral\" behaviour, purely for the purposes\\nof self-preservation.\\n\\nMany atheists behave in a \"moral\" or \"compassionate\" way simply because they\\nfeel a natural tendency to empathize with other humans.  So why do they care\\nwhat happens to others?  They don\\'t know, they simply are that way.\\n\\nNaturally, there are some people who behave \"immorally\" and try to use\\natheism to justify their actions.  However, there are equally many people who\\nbehave \"immorally\" and then try to use religious beliefs to justify their\\nactions.  For example:\\n\\n  \"Here is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance: Jesus Christ\\n   came into the world to save sinners...  But for that very reason, I was\\n   shown mercy so that in me...  Jesus Christ might display His unlimited\\n   patience as an example for those who would believe in him and receive\\n   eternal life.  Now to the king eternal, immortal, invisible, the only God,\\n   be honor and glory forever and ever.\"\\n\\nThe above quote is from a statement made to the court on February 17th 1992\\nby Jeffrey Dahmer, the notorious cannibal serial killer of Milwaukee,\\nWisconsin.  It seems that for every atheist mass-murderer, there is a\\nreligious mass-murderer.  But what of more trivial morality?\\n\\n   A survey conducted by the Roper Organization found that behavior\\n   deteriorated after \"born again\" experiences.  While only 4% of respondents\\n   said they had driven intoxicated before being \"born again,\" 12% had done\\n   so after conversion.  Similarly, 5% had used illegal drugs before\\n   conversion, 9% after.  Two percent admitted to engaging in illicit sex\\n   before salvation; 5% after.\\n                                [\"Freethought Today\", September 1991, p. 12.]\\n\\nSo it seems that at best, religion does not have a monopoly on moral\\nbehaviour.\\n\\n\"Is there such a thing as atheist morality?\"\\n\\nIf you mean \"Is there such a thing as morality for atheists?\", then the\\nanswer is yes, as explained above.  Many atheists have ideas about morality\\nwhich are at least as strong as those held by religious people.\\n\\nIf you mean \"Does atheism have a characteristic moral code?\", then the answer\\nis no.  Atheism by itself does not imply anything much about how a person\\nwill behave.  Most atheists follow many of the same \"moral rules\" as theists,\\nbut for different reasons.  Atheists view morality as something created by\\nhumans, according to the way humans feel the world \\'ought\\' to work, rather\\nthan seeing it as a set of rules decreed by a supernatural being.\\n\\n\"Then aren\\'t atheists just theists who are denying God?\"\\n\\nA study by the Freedom From Religion Foundation found that over 90% of the\\natheists who responded became atheists because religion did not work for\\nthem.  They had found that religious beliefs were fundamentally incompatible\\nwith what they observed around them.\\n\\nAtheists are not unbelievers through ignorance or denial; they are\\nunbelievers through choice.  The vast majority of them have spent time\\nstudying one or more religions, sometimes in very great depth.  They have\\nmade a careful and considered decision to reject religious beliefs.\\n\\nThis decision may, of course, be an inevitable consequence of that\\nindividual\\'s personality.  For a naturally sceptical person, the choice\\nof atheism is often the only one that makes sense, and hence the only\\nchoice that person can honestly make.\\n\\n\"But don\\'t atheists want to believe in God?\"\\n\\nAtheists live their lives as though there is nobody watching over them.  Many\\nof them have no desire to be watched over, no matter how good-natured the\\n\"Big Brother\" figure might be.\\n\\nSome atheists would like to be able to believe in God -- but so what? Should\\none believe things merely because one wants them to be true?  The risks of\\nsuch an approach should be obvious.  Atheists often decide that wanting to\\nbelieve something is not enough; there must be evidence for the belief.\\n\\n\"But of course atheists see no evidence for the existence of God -- they are\\n unwilling in their souls to see!\"\\n\\nMany, if not most atheists were previously religious.  As has been explained\\nabove, the vast majority have seriously considered the possibility that God\\nexists.  Many atheists have spent time in prayer trying to reach God.\\n\\nOf course, it is true that some atheists lack an open mind; but assuming that\\nall atheists are biased and insincere is offensive and closed-minded.\\nComments such as \"Of course God is there, you just aren\\'t looking properly\"\\nare likely to be viewed as patronizing.\\n\\nCertainly, if you wish to engage in philosophical debate with atheists it is\\nvital that you give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that they are\\nbeing sincere if they say that they have searched for God.  If you are not\\nwilling to believe that they are basically telling the truth, debate is\\nfutile.\\n\\n\"Isn\\'t the whole of life completely pointless to an atheist?\"\\n\\nMany atheists live a purposeful life.  They decide what they think gives\\nmeaning to life, and they pursue those goals.  They try to make their lives\\ncount, not by wishing for eternal life, but by having an influence on other\\npeople who will live on.  For example, an atheist may dedicate his life to\\npolitical reform, in the hope of leaving his mark on history.\\n\\nIt is a natural human tendency to look for \"meaning\" or \"purpose\" in random\\nevents.  However, it is by no means obvious that \"life\" is the sort of thing\\nthat has a \"meaning\".\\n\\nTo put it another way, not everything which looks like a question is actually\\na sensible thing to ask.  Some atheists believe that asking \"What is the\\nmeaning of life?\" is as silly as asking \"What is the meaning of a cup of\\ncoffee?\".  They believe that life has no purpose or meaning, it just is.\\n\\n\"So how do atheists find comfort in time of danger?\"\\n\\nThere are many ways of obtaining comfort; from family, friends, or even pets.\\nOr on a less spiritual level, from food or drink or TV.\\n\\nThat may sound rather an empty and vulnerable way to face danger, but so\\nwhat?  Should individuals believe in things because they are comforting, or\\nshould they face reality no matter how harsh it might be?\\n\\nIn the end, it\\'s a decision for the individual concerned.  Most atheists are\\nunable to believe something they would not otherwise believe merely because\\nit makes them feel comfortable.  They put truth before comfort, and consider\\nthat if searching for truth sometimes makes them feel unhappy, that\\'s just\\nhard luck.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t atheists worry that they might suddenly be shown to be wrong?\"\\n\\nThe short answer is \"No, do you?\"\\n\\nMany atheists have been atheists for years.  They have encountered many\\narguments and much supposed evidence for the existence of God, but they have\\nfound all of it to be invalid or inconclusive.\\n\\nThousands of years of religious belief haven\\'t resulted in any good proof of\\nthe existence of God.  Atheists therefore tend to feel that they are unlikely\\nto be proved wrong in the immediate future, and they stop worrying about it.\\n\\n\"So why should theists question their beliefs? Don\\'t the same arguments\\n apply?\"\\n\\nNo, because the beliefs being questioned are not similar.  Weak atheism is\\nthe sceptical \"default position\" to take; it asserts nothing.  Strong atheism\\nis a negative belief.  Theism is a very strong positive belief.\\n\\nAtheists sometimes also argue that theists should question their beliefs\\nbecause of the very real harm they can cause -- not just to the believers,\\nbut to everyone else.\\n\\n\"What sort of harm?\"\\n\\nReligion represents a huge financial and work burden on mankind.  It\\'s not\\njust a matter of religious believers wasting their money on church buildings;\\nthink of all the time and effort spent building churches, praying, and so on.\\nImagine how that effort could be better spent.\\n\\nMany theists believe in miracle healing.  There have been plenty of instances\\nof ill people being \"healed\" by a priest, ceasing to take the medicines\\nprescribed to them by doctors, and dying as a result.  Some theists have died\\nbecause they have refused blood transfusions on religious grounds.\\n\\nIt is arguable that the Catholic Church\\'s opposition to birth control -- and\\ncondoms in particular -- is increasing the problem of overpopulation in many\\nthird-world countries and contributing to the spread of AIDS world-wide.\\n\\nReligious believers have been known to murder their children rather than\\nallow their children to become atheists or marry someone of a different\\nreligion.\\n\\n\"Those weren\\'t REAL believers.  They just claimed to be believers as some\\n sort of excuse.\"\\n\\nWhat makes a real believer?  There are so many One True Religions it\\'s hard\\nto tell.  Look at Christianity: there are many competing groups, all\\nconvinced that they are the only true Christians.  Sometimes they even fight\\nand kill each other.  How is an atheist supposed to decide who\\'s a REAL\\nChristian and who isn\\'t, when even the major Christian churches like the\\nCatholic Church and the Church of England can\\'t decide amongst themselves?\\n\\nIn the end, most atheists take a pragmatic view, and decide that anyone who\\ncalls himself a Christian, and uses Christian belief or dogma to justify his\\nactions, should be considered a Christian.  Maybe some of those Christians\\nare just perverting Christian teaching for their own ends -- but surely if\\nthe Bible can be so readily used to support un-Christian acts it can\\'t be\\nmuch of a moral code? If the Bible is the word of God, why couldn\\'t he have\\nmade it less easy to misinterpret? And how do you know that your beliefs\\naren\\'t a perversion of what your God intended?\\n\\nIf there is no single unambiguous interpretation of the Bible, then why\\nshould an atheist take one interpretation over another just on your say-so?\\nSorry, but if someone claims that he believes in Jesus and that he murdered\\nothers because Jesus and the Bible told him to do so, we must call him a\\nChristian.\\n\\n\"Obviously those extreme sorts of beliefs should be questioned.  But since\\n nobody has ever proved that God does not exist, it must be very unlikely\\n that more basic religious beliefs, shared by all faiths, are nonsense.\"\\n\\nThat does not hold, because as was pointed out at the start of this dialogue,\\npositive assertions concerning the existence of entities are inherently much\\nharder to disprove than negative ones.  Nobody has ever proved that unicorns\\ndon\\'t exist, but that doesn\\'t make it unlikely that they are myths.\\n\\nIt is therefore much more valid to hold a negative assertion by default than\\nit is to hold a positive assertion by default.  Of course, \"weak\" atheists\\nwould argue that asserting nothing is better still.\\n\\n\"Well, if atheism\\'s so great, why are there so many theists?\"\\n\\nUnfortunately, the popularity of a belief has little to do with how \"correct\"\\nit is, or whether it \"works\"; consider how many people believe in astrology,\\ngraphology, and other pseudo-sciences.\\n\\nMany atheists feel that it is simply a human weakness to want to believe in\\ngods.  Certainly in many primitive human societies, religion allows the\\npeople to deal with phenomena that they do not adequately understand.\\n\\nOf course, there\\'s more to religion than that.  In the industrialized world,\\nwe find people believing in religious explanations of phenomena even when\\nthere are perfectly adequate natural explanations.  Religion may have started\\nas a means of attempting to explain the world, but nowadays it serves other\\npurposes as well.\\n\\n\"But so many cultures have developed religions.  Surely that must say\\n something?\"\\n\\nNot really.  Most religions are only superficially similar; for example, it\\'s\\nworth remembering that religions such as Buddhism and Taoism lack any sort of\\nconcept of God in the Christian sense.\\n\\nOf course, most religions are quick to denounce competing religions, so it\\'s\\nrather odd to use one religion to try and justify another.\\n\\n\"What about all the famous scientists and philosophers who have concluded\\n that God exists?\"\\n\\nFor every scientist or philosopher who believes in a god, there is one who\\ndoes not.  Besides, as has already been pointed out, the truth of a belief is\\nnot determined by how many people believe it.  Also, it is important to\\nrealize that atheists do not view famous scientists or philosophers in the\\nsame way that theists view their religious leaders.\\n\\nA famous scientist is only human; she may be an expert in some fields, but\\nwhen she talks about other matters her words carry no special weight.  Many\\nrespected scientists have made themselves look foolish by speaking on\\nsubjects which lie outside their fields of expertise.\\n\\n\"So are you really saying that widespread belief in religion indicates\\n nothing?\"\\n\\nNot entirely.  It certainly indicates that the religion in question has\\nproperties which have helped it so spread so far.\\n\\nThe theory of memetics talks of \"memes\" -- sets of ideas which can propagate\\nthemselves between human minds, by analogy with genes.  Some atheists view\\nreligions as sets of particularly successful parasitic memes, which spread by\\nencouraging their hosts to convert others.  Some memes avoid destruction by\\ndiscouraging believers from questioning doctrine, or by using peer pressure\\nto keep one-time believers from admitting that they were mistaken.  Some\\nreligious memes even encourage their hosts to destroy hosts controlled by\\nother memes.\\n\\nOf course, in the memetic view there is no particular virtue associated with\\nsuccessful propagation of a meme.  Religion is not a good thing because of\\nthe number of people who believe it, any more than a disease is a good thing\\nbecause of the number of people who have caught it.\\n\\n\"Even if religion is not entirely true, at least it puts across important\\n messages.  What are the fundamental messages of atheism?\"\\n\\nThere are many important ideas atheists promote.  The following are just a\\nfew of them; don\\'t be surprised to see ideas which are also present in some\\nreligions.\\n\\n   There is more to moral behaviour than mindlessly following rules.\\n\\n   Be especially sceptical of positive claims.\\n\\n   If you want your life to have some sort of meaning, it\\'s up to you to\\n   find it.\\n\\n   Search for what is true, even if it makes you uncomfortable.\\n\\n   Make the most of your life, as it\\'s probably the only one you\\'ll have.\\n\\n   It\\'s no good relying on some external power to change you; you must change\\n   yourself.\\n\\n   Just because something\\'s popular doesn\\'t mean it\\'s good.\\n\\n   If you must assume something, assume something it\\'s easy to test.\\n\\n   Don\\'t believe things just because you want them to be true.\\n\\nand finally (and most importantly):\\n\\n   All beliefs should be open to question.\\n\\nThanks for taking the time to read this article.\\n\\n\\nmathew\\n\\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\\nVersion: 2.2\\n\\niQCVAgUBK8AjRXzXN+VrOblFAQFSbwP+MHePY4g7ge8Mo5wpsivX+kHYYxMErFAO\\n7ltVtMVTu66Nz6sBbPw9QkbjArbY/S2sZ9NF5htdii0R6SsEyPl0R6/9bV9okE/q\\nnihqnzXE8pGvLt7tlez4EoeHZjXLEFrdEyPVayT54yQqGb4HARbOEHDcrTe2atmP\\nq0Z4hSSPpAU=\\n=q2V5\\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\\n\\nFor information about PGP 2.2, send mail to pgpinfo@mantis.co.uk.\\nÿ\\n',\n",

[*]\\n\\nSince your viewpoint is always the same, the routines can be hard-coded\\nfor a particular vantage.  In my case, wall two\\'s rising edge has a slope\\nof 1/4. (I\\'m also using Mode X, 320x240).\\n\\nI\\'ve run into two problems; I\\'m sure that other readers have tried this\\nbefore, and have perhaps formulated their own opinions:\\n\\n1) The routines for drawing walls 1 & 2 were trivial, but when I ran a\\npacked->planar image through them, I was dismayed by the \"jaggies.\"  I\\'m\\nnow considered some anti-aliasing routines (speed is not really necessary).\\nIs it worth the effort to have the artist draw the wall already skewed,\\nthus being assured of nice image, or is this too much of a burden?\\n\\n2) Wall 3 presents a problem; the algorithm I used tends to overly distort\\nthe original.  I tried to decide on paper what pixels go where, and failed.\\nHas anyone come up with method for mapping a planar to crosswise sheared\\nshape?\\n\\nCurrently I take:\\n\\n  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16\\n 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32\\n 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48\\n 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64\\n\\nand produce:\\n            \\n             1  2  3  4\\n33 34 35 36 17 18 19 20  5  6  7  8\\n49 50 51 52 37 38 39 40 21 22 23 24  9 10 11 12\\n            53 54 55 56 41 42 43 44 25 26 27 28 13 14 15 16\\n                        57 58 59 60 45 46 47 48 29 30 31 32\\n                                    61 62 63 64\\n\\nLine 1 follows the slope.

On the 10th I had got my crew, done the paper-\\nwork, and left for the Zhdanov District. That\\'s in Azerbaijan, near the\\nNagorno Karabagh region.\\n\\nAfter the 14th, rumors started to the effect that in Karabagh, specifically\\nin Stepanakert, an uprising had taken place. They said \"uprising\" in\\nAzerbaijani, but I don\\'t think it was really an uprising, just a \\ndemonstration. After that the unrest started. Several Armenians living in the \\nZhdanov District were injured. How were they injured? They were beaten, even \\nwomen; it was said that they were at the demonstrations, but they live here, \\nand went from here to Karabagh to demonstrate. After that I felt uneasy. There\\nwere some conversations about Armenians among the local population: the\\nArmenians had done this, the Armenians had done that. Right there at the site.\\nI was attacked a couple of times by kids. Well true, the guys from my crew \\nwouldn\\'t let them come at me with cables and knives. After that I felt really \\nbad. I didn\\'t know where to go. I up and called home. And my children tell me,\\n\"There\\'s unrest everywhere, be careful.\" Well I had a project going on. I told\\nthe Second Secretary of the District Party Committee what had been going on \\nand said I wanted to take my crew off the site. They wouldn\\'t allow it, they \\nsaid, \"Nothing\\'s going to happen to you, we\\'ve entrusted the matter to the \\npolice, we\\'ve warned everyone in the district, nothing will happen to you.\" \\nWell, in fact they did especially detail us a policeman to look after me, he \\nknows all the local people and would protect me if something happened. This\\nman didn\\'t leave me alone for five minutes: he was at work the whole time and \\nafterward he spent the night with us, too.\\n\\nI sense some disquiet and call home; my wife also tells me, \"The situation is\\nvery tense, be careful.\"\\n\\nWe finished the job at the site, and I left for Sumgait first thing on the\\nmorning of the 29th. When we left the guys warned me, they told me that I\\nshouldn\\'t tell anyone on the way that I was an Armenian. I took someone else\\'s\\nbusiness travel documents, in the name of Zardali, and hid my own. I hid it \\nand my passport in my socks. We set out for Baku. Our guys were on the bus, \\nthey sat behind, and I sat up front. In Baku they had come to me and said that\\nthey had to collect all of our travel documents just in case. As it turns out \\nthey knew what was happening in Sumgait.\\n\\nI arrive at the bus station and there they tell me that the city of Sumgait is\\nclosed, there is no way to get there. That the city is closed off and the \\nbuses aren\\'t running. Buses normally leave Baku for Sumgait almost every two\\nminutes. And suddenly--no buses. Well, we tried to get there via private\\ndrivers. One man, an Azerbaijani, said, \"Let\\'s go find some other way to get\\nthere.\" They found a light transport vehicle and arranged for the driver to\\ntake us to Sumgait.\\n\\nHe took us there. But the others had said, \"I wouldn\\'t go if you gave me a\\nthousand rubles.\" \"Why?\" \"Because they\\'re burning the city and killing the\\nArmenians. There isn\\'t an Armenian left.\" Well I got hold of myself so I could\\nstill stand up. So we squared it away, the four of us got in the car, and we \\nset off for Sumgait. On the way the driver says, \"In fact there aren\\'t any\\nArmenians left. \\'They burned them all, beat them all, and stabbed them.\" Well \\nI was silent. The whole way--20-odd miles--I was silent. The driver asks me, \\n\"How old are you, old man?\" He wants to know: if I\\'m being that quiet, not \\nsaying anything, maybe it means I\\'m an Armenian. \"How old are you?\" he asks \\nme. I say, \"I\\'m 47.\" \"I\\'m 47 too, but I call you \\'old man\\'.\" I say, \"It \\ndepends on God, each person\\'s life in this world is different.\" I look much\\nolder than my years, that\\'s why he called me old man. Well after that he was\\nsilent, too.\\n\\nWe\\'re approaching the city, I look and see tanks all around, and a cordon.\\nBefore we get to the Kavkaz store the driver starts to wave his hand. Well, he\\nwas waving his hand, we all start waving our hands. I\\'m sitting there with\\nthem, I start waving my hand, too. I realized that this was a sign that meant\\nthere were no Armenians with us.\\n\\nI look at the city--there is a crowd of people walking down the middle of the \\nstreet, you know, and there\\'s no traffic. Well probably I was scared. They\\nstopped our car. People were standing on the sidewalks. They have armature \\nshafts, and stones . . . And they stopped us . . .\\n\\nAlong the way the driver tells us how they know who\\'s an Armenian and who\\'s \\nnot. The Armenians usually . . . For example, I\\'m an Armenian, but I speak \\ntheir language very well. Well Armenians usually pronounce the Azeri word for \\n\"nut,\" or \"little nut,\" as \"pundukh,\" but \"fundukh\" is actually correct. The \\npronunciations are different. Anyone who says \"pundukh,\" even if they\\'re not \\nArmenian, they immediately take out and start to slash. Another one says, \\n\"There was a car there, with five people inside it,\" he says. \"They started \\nhitting the side of it with an axe and lit it on fire. And they didn\\'t let the\\npeople out,\" he says, \"they wouldn\\'t let them get out of the car.\" I only saw \\nthe car, but the driver says that he saw everything. Well he often drives from\\nBaku to Sumgait and back . . .\\n\\nWhen they stop us we all get out of the car. I look and there\\'s a short guy,\\nhis eyes are gleaming, he has an armature shaft in one hand and a stone in\\nthe other and asks the guys what nationality they are one by one. \"We\\'re\\nAzerbaijani,\\' they tell him, \\'no Armenians here.\" He did come up to me when \\nwe were pulling our things out and says, \"Maybe you\\'re an Armenian, old man?\" \\nBut in Azerbaijani I say, \"You should be ashamed of yourself!\" And . . . he \\nleft. Turned and left. That was all that happened. What was I to do? I had \\nto . . . the city was on fire, but I had to steal my children out of my own \\nhome.\\n\\nThey stopped us at the entrance to Mir Street, that\\'s where the Kavkaz store \\nand three large, 12-story buildings are. That\\'s the beginning of down-town. I \\nsaw that burned automobile there, completely burned, only metal remained. I \\ncouldn\\'t figure out if it was a Zhiguli or a Zaporozhets. Later I was told it \\nwas a Zhiguli. And the people in there were completely incinerated. Nothing \\nremained of them, not even any traces. That driver had told me about it, and I\\nsaw the car myself. The car was there. The skeleton, a metallic carcass. About\\n30 to 40 yards from the Kavkaz store.\\n\\nI see a military transport, an armored personnel carrier. The hatches are\\nclosed. And people are throwing armature shafts and pieces of iron at it, the\\ncrowd is. And I hear shots, not automatic fire, it\\'s true, but pistol shots.\\nSeveral shots. There were Azerbaijanis crowded around that personnel carrier. \\nSomeone in the crowd was shooting. Apparently they either wanted to kill the \\nsoldiers or get a machine gun or something. At that point there was only one \\narmored personnel carrier. And all the tanks were outside the city, cordoning \\noff Sumgait.\\n\\nI walked on. I see two Azerbaijanis going home from the plant. I can tell by \\ntheir gait that they\\'re not bandits, they\\'re just people, walking home. I\\njoined them so in case something happened, in case someone came up to us\\nand asked questions, either of us would be in a position to answer, you see.\\nBut I avoided the large groups because I\\'m a local and might be quickly \\nrecognized. I tried to keep at a distance, and walked where there were fewer\\npeople. Well so I walked into Microdistrict 2, which is across from our block.\\nI can\\'t get into our block, but I walked where there were fewer people, so as \\nto get around. Well there I see a tall guy and 25 to 30 people are walking \\nbehind him. And he\\'s shouting into a megaphone: \"Comrades, the Armenian-\\nAzerbaijani war has begun!\"\\n\\nThe police have megaphones like that. So they\\'re talking and walking around \\nthe second microdistrict. I see that they\\'re coming my way, and turn off \\nbehind a building. I noticed that they walked around the outside buildings, \\nand inside the microdistricts there were about 5 or 6 people standing on every\\ncorner, and at the middles of the buildings, and at the edges. What they were \\ndoing I can\\'t say, because I couldn\\'t get up close to them, I was afraid. But \\nthe most important thing was to get away from there, to get home, and at least\\nfind out if my children were alive or not . . .\\n\\n   April 20, 1988\\n   Yerevan\\n\\n\\t\\t     - - - reference - - -\\n\\n[1] _The Sumgait Tragedy; Pogroms against Armenians in Soviet Azerbaijan,\\n    Volume I, Eyewitness Accounts_, edited by Samuel Shahmuradian, forward by\\n    Yelena Bonner, 1990, published by Aristide D.

Fundamental human rights, such as the right to life, to\\neducation, to establish a family and have children, to human\\ndignity, the right to free movement, to free expression, etc. are\\nmore important to human existence that the rights of states.\\n\\n2.      In the event of a conflict between basic human rights and\\nrights of collectivities, basic human rights should prevail.\\n\\n3.      Between the collectivities defining themselves as\\nJewish-Israeli and Palestinian-Arab, however labelled, an\\nunresolved conflict exists.\\n\\n4.      This conflict has caused great sufferings for millions of\\npeople. It moreover poisons relations between communities, peoples\\nand nations.\\n\\n5.      Each year, the United States expends billions of dollars\\nin economic and military aid to the conflicting parties.\\n\\n6.      Attempts to solve the Israeli-Arab conflict by traditional\\npolitical means have failed.\\n\\n7.      As long as the conflict is perceived as that between two\\ndistinct ethnical/religious communities/peoples which claim the\\nland, there is no just nor peaceful solution possible.\\n\\n8.      Love between human beings can be capitalized for the sake\\nof peace and justice. When people love, they share.\\n\\nHaving stated my assumptions, I will now state my proposal.\\n\\n1.      A Fund should be established which would disburse grants\\nfor each child born to a couple where one partner is Israeli-Jew\\nand the other Palestinian-Arab.\\n\\n2.      To be entitled for a grant, a couple will have to prove\\nthat one of the partners possesses or is entitled to Israeli\\ncitizenship under the Law of Return and the other partner,\\nalthough born in areas under current Isreali control, is not\\nentitled to such citizenship under the Law of Return.\\n\\n3.      For the first child, the grant will amount to $18.000. For\\nthe second the third child, $12.000 for each child. For each\\nsubsequent child, the grant will amount to $6.000 for each child.\\n\\n\\n4.      The Fund would be financed by a variety of sources which\\nhave shown interest in promoting a peaceful solution to the\\nIsraeli-Arab conflict, including the U.S. Government, Jewish and\\nChristian organizations in the U.S.  and a great number of\\ngovernments and international organizations.\\n\\n5.      The emergence of a considerable number of 'mixed'\\nmarriages in Israel/Palestine, all of whom would have relatives on\\n'both sides' of the divide, would make the conflict lose its\\nethnical and unsoluble core and strengthen the emergence of a\\ntruly civil society. The existence of a strong 'mixed' stock of\\npeople would also help the integration of Israeli society into the\\nMiddle-East in a graceful manner.\\n\\nObjections to this proposal will certainly be voiced. I will\\nattempt to identify some of these:\\n\\n1.      The idea of providing financial incentives to selected\\nforms of partnership and marriage, is not conventional. However,\\nit is based on the concept of affirmative action, which is\\nrecognized as a legitimate form of public policy to reverse the\\nperverse effects of segregation and discrimination. International\\nlaw clearly permits affirmative action when it is aimed at\\nreducing racial discrimination and segregation.\\n\\n2.      It may be objected that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict\\nis not primarily a religious or ethnical conflict, but that it is\\na conflict between a colonialist settler society and an indigenous\\ncolonized society that can only regain its freedom by armed\\nstruggle. This objection is based on the assumption that the\\n'enemy' is not Zionism as ideology and practice, but\\nIsraeli-Jewish society and its members which will have to be\\ndefeated. This objection has no merit because it does not fulfill\\nthe first two assumptions concerning the primacy of fundamental\\nhuman rights over collective rights (see above)\\n\\n3.      Fundamentalist Jews would certainly object to the use of\\nfinancial incentives to encourage 'mixed marriages'. From their\\npoint of view, the continued existence of a specific Jewish People\\noverrides any other consideration, be it human love, peace of\\nhuman rights.  The President of the World Jewish Congress, Edgar\\nBronfman, reflected this view a few years ago in an interview he\\ngave to Der Spiegel, a German magazine. He called the increasing\\nassimilation of Jews in the world a <calamity>, comparable in its\\neffects only with the Holocaust. This objection has no merit\\neither because it does not fulfill the first two assumptions (see\\nabove)\\n\\n4.      It may objected that only a few people in\\nIsrael/Palestine, would request such grants and that it would thus\\nnot serve its purpose. To this objection one might respond that\\nalthough it is not possible to determine with certainty the effect\\nof such a proposal, the existence of such a Fund would help mixed\\ncouples to resist the pressure of their respective societies and\\nencourage young couples to reject fundamentalist and racist\\nattitudes.\\n\\n5.      It may objected that such a Fund would need great sums to\\nbring about substantial demographic changes. This objection has\\nmerits. However, it must be remembered that huge sums, more than\\n$3 billion, are expended each year by the United States government\\nand by U.S. organizations to maintain an elusive peace in the\\nMiddle-East through armaments. A mere fraction of these sums would\\nsuffice to launch the above proposal and create a more favorable\\nclimate towards the existence of 'mixed' marriages in\\nIsrael/Palestine, thus encouraging the emergence of a\\nnon-segregated society in that worn-torn land.\\n\\nI would be thankful for critical comments to the above proposal as\\nwell for any dissemination of this proposal for meaningful\\ndiscussion and enrichment.\\n\\nElias Davidsson Post Box 1760 121 Reykjavik, ICELAND\\n\\n\",\n",

Friday local Tel Aviv\\'s\\npaper, affiliated with Maariv.\\n\\nDate: 19 February 1993\\n\\nJournalist: Guy Ehrlich\\n\\nSubject: Interview with soldiers who served in the Duvdevan\\n(Cherry) units, which disguise themselves as Arabs and operate\\nwithin the occupied territories.\\n\\nExcerpts from the article:\\n\\n\"A lot has been written about the units who disguise themselves as\\nArabs, things good and bad, some of the falsehoods. But the most\\nimportant problem of those units has been hardly dealt with. It is\\nthat everyone who serves in the Cherry, after a time goes in one\\nway or another insane\".\\n\\nA man who said this, who will here be called Danny (his full name\\nis known to the editors) served in the Cherry. After his discharge\\nfrom the army he works as delivery boy. His pal, who will here be\\ncalled Dudu was also serving in the Cherry, and is now about to\\ndepart for a round-the-world tour. They both look no different\\nfrom average Israeli youngsters freshly discharged from conscript\\nservice. But in their souls, one can notice something completely\\ndifferent....It was not easy for them to come out with disclosures\\nabout what happened to them. And they think that to most of their\\nfellows from the Cherry it woundn\\'t be easy either. Yet after they\\nbegan to talk, it was nearly impossible to make them stop talking.\\nThe following article will contain all the horror stories\\nrecounted with an appalling openness.\\n\\n(...) A short time ago I was in command of a veteran team, in\\nwhich some of the fellows applied for release from the Cherry. We\\ncalled such soldiers H.I. \\'Hit by the Intifada\\'. Under my command\\nwas a soldier who talked to himself non-stop, which is a common\\nphenomenon in the Cherry. I sent him to a psychiatrist. But why I\\nshould talk about others when I myself feel quite insane ? On\\nFridays, when I come home, my parents know I cannot be talked to\\nuntil I go to the beach, surf a little, calm down and return. The\\nkeys of my father\\'s car must be ready for in advance, so that I\\ncan go there. I they dare talk to me before, or whenever I don\\'t\\nwant them to talk to me, I just grab a chair and smash it\\ninstantly. I know it is my nerve:  Smashing chairs all the time\\nand then running away from home, to the car and to the beach. Only\\nthere I become normal.(...)\\n\\n(...) Another friday I was eating a lunch prepared by my mother.\\nIt was an omelette of sorts. She took the risk of sitting next to\\nme and talking to me. I then told my mother about an event which\\nwas still fresh in my mind. I told her how I shot an Arab, and how\\nexactly his wound looked like when I went to inspect it. She began\\nto laugh hysterically. I wanted her to cry, and she dared laugh\\nstraight in my face instead ! So I told her how my pal had made a\\nmincemeat of the two Arabs who were preparing the Molotov\\ncocktails. He shot them down, hitting them beautifully, exactly as\\nthey deserved. One bullet had set a Molotov cocktail on fire, with\\nthe effect that the Arab was burning all over, just beautifully. I\\nwas delighted to see it.  My pal fired three bullets, two at the\\nArab with the Molotov cocktail, and the third at his chum. It hit\\nhim straight in his ass. We both felt that we\\'d pulled off\\nsomething.\\n\\nNext I told my mother how another pal of mine split open the guts\\nin the belly of another Arab and how all of us ran toward that\\nspot to take a look. I reached the spot first. And then that Arab,\\nblood gushing forth from his body, spits at me. I yelled: \\'Shut\\nup\\' and he dared talk back to me in Hebrew! So I just laughed\\nstraight in his face. I am usually laughing when I stare at\\nsomething convulsing right before my eyes. Then I told him: \\'All\\nright, wait a moment\\'. I left him in order to take a look at\\nanother wounded Arab. I asked a soldier if that Arab could be\\nsaved, if the bleeding from his artery could be stopped with the\\nhelp of a stone of something else like that. I keep telling all\\nthis to my mother, with details, and she keeps laughing straight\\ninto my face. This infuriated me. I got very angry, because I felt\\nI was becoming mad. So I stopped eating, seized the plate with he\\nomelette and some trimmings still on, and at once threw it over\\nher head. Only then she stopped laughing. At first she didn\\'t know\\nwhat to say.\\n\\n(...) But I must tell you of a still other madness which falls\\nupon us frequently. I went with a friend to practice shooting on a\\nfield. A gull appeared right in the middle of the field. My friend\\nshot it at once. Then we noticed four deer standing high up on the\\nhill above us. My friend at once aimed at one of them and shot it.\\nWe enjoyed the sight of it falling down the rock. We shot down two\\ndeer more and went to take a look. When we climbed the rocks we\\nsaw a young deer, badly wounded by our bullet, but still trying to\\nsuch some milk from its already dead mother. We carefully\\ninspected two paths, covered by blood and chunks of torn flesh of\\nthe two deer we had hit. We were just delighted by that sight. We\\nhad hit\\'em so good ! Then we decided to kill the young deer too,\\nso as spare it further suffering. I approached, took out my\\nrevolver and shot him in the head several times from a very short\\ndistance. When you shoot straight at the head you actually see the\\nbullets sinking in.  But my fifth bullet made its brains fall\\noutside onto the ground, with the effect of splattering lots of\\nblood straight on us. This made us feel cured of the spurt of our\\nmadness. Standing there soaked with blood, we felt we were like\\nbeasts of prey. We couldn\\'t explain what had happened to us. We\\nwere almost in tears while walking down from that hill, and we\\nfelt the whole day very badly.\\n\\n(...) We always go back to places we carried out assignments in.\\nThis is why we can see them. When you see a guy you disabled, may\\nbe for the rest of his life, you feel you got power. You feel\\nGodlike of sorts.\"\\n\\n(...) Both Danny and Dudu contemplate at least at this moment\\nstudying the acting. Dudu is not willing to work in any\\nsecurity-linked occupation. Danny feels the exact opposite. \\'Why\\nshouldn\\'t I take advantage of the skills I have mastered so well ?\\nWhy shouldn\\'t I earn $3.000 for each chopped head I would deliver\\nwhile being a mercenary in South Africa ? This kind of job suits\\nme perfectly. I have no human emotions any more. If I get a\\nreasonable salary I will have no problem to board a plane to\\nBosnia in order to fight there.\"\\n\\nTransl. by Israel Shahak.\\n\\n',\n",

Let's do it right this\\ntime!  Let's step back and consider the functionality we want:\\n\\n[1] microgravity/vacuum process research\\n[2] life sciences research (adaptation to space)\\n[3] spacecraft maintenence \\n\\nThe old NASA approach, explified by Shuttle and SSF so far, was to\\ncentralize functionality.  These projects failed to meet\\ntheir targets by a wide margin: the military and commercial users \\ntook most of their payloads off Shuttle after wasting much effort to \\ntie their payloads to it, and SSF has crumbled into disorganization\\nand miscommunication.  Over $50 billion has been spent on these\\ntwo projects with no reduction in launch costs and littel improvement\\nin commercial space industrialization.  Meanwhile, military and commercial \\nusers have come up with a superior strategy for space development: the \\nconstellation.  \\n\\nFirstly, different functions are broken down into different \\nconstellations placed in the optimal orbit for each function:\\nthus we have the GPS/Navstar constellation in 12-hour orbits,\\ncomsats in Clarke and Molniya orbits, etc.  Secondly, the task\\nis distributed amongst several spacecraft in a constellation,\\nproviding for redundancy and full coverage where needed.\\n\\nSSF's 3 main functions require quite different environments\\nand are also prime candidates for constellization.\\n\\n[1] We have the makings of a microgravity constellation now:\\nCOMET and Mir for long-duration flights, Shuttle/Spacelab for\\nshort-duration flights.  The best strategy for this area is\\ninexpensive, incremental improvement: installation of U.S. facilities \\non Mir, Shuttle/Mir linkup, and transition from Shuttle/Spacelab\\nto a much less expensive SSTO/Spacehab/COMET or SSTO/SIF/COMET.\\nWe might also expand the research program to take advantage of \\ninteresting space environments, eg the high-radiation Van Allen belt \\nor gas/plasma gradients in comet tails.  The COMET system can\\nbe much more easily retrofitted for these tasks, where a \\nstation is too large to affordably launch beyond LEO.\\n\\n[2] We need to study life sciences not just in microgravity,\\nbut also in lunar and Martian gravities, and in the radiation\\nenvironments of deep space instead of the protected shelter\\nof LEO.  This is a very long-term, low-priority project, since\\nastronauts will have little practical use in the space program\\nuntil costs come down orders of magnitude.  Furthermore, using\\nastronauts severely restricts the scope of the investigation,\\nand the sample size.  So I propose LabRatSat, a constellation\\ntether-bolo satellites that test out various levels of gravity\\nin super-Van-Allen-Belt orbits that are representative of the\\nradiation environment encountered on Earth-Moon, Earth-Mars,\\nEarth-asteroid, etc. trips.  The miniaturized life support\\nmachinery might be operated real-time from earth thru a VR\\ninterface.  AFter several orbital missions have been flown,\\nfollow-ons can act as LDEFs on the lunar and Martian surface,\\ntesting out the actual environment at low cost before $billions\\nare spent on astronauts.\\n\\n[3] By far the largest market for spacecraft servicing is in \\nClarke orbit.  I propose a fleet of small teleoperated\\nrobots and small test satellites on which ground engineers can\\npractice their skills.  Once in place, robots can pry stuck\\nsolar arrays and antennas, attach solar battery power packs,\\ninject fuel, etc.  Once the fleet is working, it can be\\nspun off to commercial company(s) who can work with the comsat\\ncompanies to develop comsat replaceable module standards.\\n\\nBy applying the successful constellation strategy, and getting\\nrid of the failed centralized strategy of STS and old SSF, we\\nhave radically improved the capability of the program while\\ngreatly cutting its cost.  For a fraction of SSF's pricetag,\\nwe can fix satellites where the satellites are, we can study\\nlife's adaptation to a much large & more representative variety \\nof space environments, and we can do microgravity and vacuum\\nresearch inexpensively and, if needed, in special-purpose\\norbits.\\n\\nN.B., we can apply the constellation strategy to space exploration\\nas well, greatly cutting its cost and increasing its functionality.  \\nMars Network and Artemis are two good examples of this; more ambitiously \\nwe can set up a network of native propellant plants on Mars that can be used\\nto fuel planet-wide rover/ballistic hopper prospecting and\\nsample return.  The descendants of LabRatSat's technology can\\nbe used as a Mars surface LDEF and to test out closed-ecology\\ngreenhouses on Mars at low cost.\\n\\n\\n-- \\nNick Szabo\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t szabo@techboook.com\\n\",\n",

The manifest is also available from the Ames SPACE\\n    archive in SPACE/FAQ/manifest. The portion of his manifest formerly\\n    included in this FAQ has been removed; please refer to his posting or\\n    the archived copy. For the most up to date information on upcoming\\n    missions, call (407) 867-INFO (867-4636) at Kennedy Space Center.\\n\\n    Official NASA shuttle status reports are posted to sci.space.news\\n    frequently.\\n\\n\\n    WHY DOES THE SHUTTLE ROLL JUST AFTER LIFTOFF?\\n\\n    The following answer and translation are provided by Ken Jenks\\n    (kjenks@gothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov).\\n\\n    The \"Ascent Guidance and Flight Control Training Manual,\" ASC G&C 2102,\\n    says:\\n\\n\\t\"During the vertical rise phase, the launch pad attitude is\\n\\tcommanded until an I-loaded V(rel) sufficient to assure launch tower\\n\\tclearance is achieved. Then, the tilt maneuver (roll program)\\n\\torients the vehicle to a heads down attitude required to generate a\\n\\tnegative q-alpha, which in turn alleviates structural loading. Other\\n\\tadvantages with this attitude are performance gain, decreased abort\\n\\tmaneuver complexity, improved S-band look angles, and crew view of\\n\\tthe horizon. The tilt maneuver is also required to start gaining\\n\\tdownrange velocity to achieve the main engine cutoff (MECO) target\\n\\tin second stage.\"\\n\\n    This really is a good answer, but it\\'s couched in NASA jargon. I\\'ll try\\n    to interpret.\\n\\n    1)\\tWe wait until the Shuttle clears the tower before rolling.\\n\\n    2)\\tThen, we roll the Shuttle around so that the angle of attack\\n\\tbetween the wind caused by passage through the atmosphere (the\\n\\t\"relative wind\") and the chord of the wings (the imaginary line\\n\\tbetween the leading edge and the trailing edge) is a slightly\\n\\tnegative angle (\"a negative q-alpha\").\\tThis causes a little bit of\\n\\t\"downward\" force (toward the belly of the Orbiter, or the +Z\\n\\tdirection) and this force \"alleviates structural loading.\"\\n\\tWe have to be careful about those wings -- they\\'re about the\\n\\tmost \"delicate\" part of the vehicle.\\n\\n    3)\\tThe new attitude (after the roll) also allows us to carry more\\n\\tmass to orbit, or to achieve a higher orbit with the same mass, or\\n\\tto change the orbit to a higher or lower inclination than would be\\n\\tthe case if we didn\\'t roll (\"performance gain\").\\n\\n    4)\\tThe new attitude allows the crew to fly a less complicated\\n\\tflight path if they had to execute one of the more dangerous abort\\n\\tmaneuvers, the Return To Launch Site (\"decreased abort maneuver\\n\\tcomplexity\").\\n\\n    5)\\tThe new attitude improves the ability for ground-based radio\\n\\tantennae to have a good line-of-sight signal with the S-band radio\\n\\tantennae on the Orbiter (\"improved S-band look angles\").\\n\\n    6)\\tThe new attitude allows the crew to see the horizon, which is a\\n\\thelpful (but not mandatory) part of piloting any flying machine.\\n\\n    7)\\tThe new attitude orients the Shuttle so that the body is\\n\\tmore nearly parallel with the ground, and the nose to the east\\n\\t(usually).  This allows the thrust from the engines to add velocity\\n\\tin the correct direction to eventually achieve orbit.  Remember:\\n\\tvelocity is a vector quantity made of both speed and direction.\\n\\tThe Shuttle has to have a large horizontal component to its\\n\\tvelocity and a very small vertical component to attain orbit.\\n\\n    This all begs the question, \"Why isn\\'t the launch pad oriented to give\\n    this nice attitude to begin with?  Why does the Shuttle need to roll to\\n    achieve that attitude?\"  The answer is that the pads were leftovers\\n    from the Apollo days.  The Shuttle straddles two flame trenches -- one\\n    for the Solid Rocket Motor exhaust, one for the Space Shuttle Main\\n    Engine exhaust.  (You can see the effects of this on any daytime\\n    launch.  The SRM exhaust is dirty gray garbage, and the SSME exhaust is\\n    fluffy white steam.  Watch for the difference between the \"top\"\\n    [Orbiter side] and the \"bottom\" [External Tank side] of the stack.) The\\n    access tower and other support and service structure are all oriented\\n    basically the same way they were for the Saturn V\\'s.  (A side note: the\\n    Saturn V\\'s also had a roll program.  Don\\'t ask me why -- I\\'m a Shuttle\\n    guy.)\\n\\n    I checked with a buddy in Ascent Dynamics.\\tHe added that the \"roll\\n    maneuver\" is really a maneuver in all three axes: roll, pitch and yaw.\\n    The roll component of that maneuver is performed for the reasons\\n    stated.  The pitch component controls loading on the wings by keeping\\n    the angle of attack (q-alpha) within a tight tolerance.  The yaw\\n    component is used to determine the orbital inclination.  The total\\n    maneuver is really expressed as a \"quaternion,\" a grad-level-math\\n    concept for combining all three rotation matrices in one four-element\\n    array.\\n\\n\\n    HOW TO RECEIVE THE NASA TV CHANNEL, NASA SELECT\\n\\n    NASA SELECT is broadcast by satellite. If you have access to a satellite\\n    dish, you can find SELECT on Satcom F2R, Transponder 13, C-Band, 72\\n    degrees West Longitude, Audio 6.8, Frequency 3960 MHz. F2R is stationed\\n    over the Atlantic, and is increasingly difficult to receive from\\n    California and points west. During events of special interest (e.g.\\n    shuttle missions), SELECT is sometimes broadcast on a second satellite\\n    for these viewers.\\n\\n    If you can\\'t get a satellite feed, some cable operators carry SELECT.\\n    It\\'s worth asking if yours doesn\\'t.\\n\\n    The SELECT schedule is found in the NASA Headline News which is\\n    frequently posted to sci.space.news. Generally it carries press\\n    conferences, briefings by NASA officials, and live coverage of shuttle\\n    missions and planetary encounters. SELECT has recently begun carrying\\n    much more secondary material (associated with SPACELINK) when missions\\n    are not being covered.\\n\\n\\n    AMATEUR RADIO FREQUENCIES FOR SHUTTLE MISSIONS\\n\\n    The following are believed to rebroadcast space shuttle mission audio:\\n\\n\\tW6FXN  - Los Angeles\\n\\tK6MF   - Ames Research Center, Mountain View, California\\n\\tWA3NAN - Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC), Greenbelt, Maryland.\\n\\tW5RRR  - Johnson Space Center (JSC), Houston, Texas\\n\\tW6VIO  - Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), Pasadena, California.\\n\\tW1AW Voice Bulletins\\n\\n\\tStation    VHF\\t   10m\\t   15m\\t   20m\\t  40m\\t 80m\\n\\t------\\t ------  ------  ------  ------  -----\\t-----\\n\\tW6FXN\\t 145.46\\n\\tK6MF\\t 145.585\\t\\t\\t 7.165\\t3.840\\n\\tWA3NAN\\t 147.45  28.650  21.395  14.295  7.185\\t3.860\\n\\tW5RRR\\t 146.64  28.400  21.350  14.280  7.227\\t3.850\\n\\tW6VIO\\t 224.04\\t\\t 21.340  14.270\\n\\tW6VIO\\t 224.04\\t\\t 21.280  14.282  7.165\\t3.840\\n\\tW1AW\\t\\t 28.590  21.390  14.290  7.290\\t3.990\\n\\n    W5RRR transmits mission audio on 146.64, a special event station on the\\n    other frequencies supplying Keplerian Elements and mission information.\\n\\n    W1AW also transmits on 147.555, 18.160.

Some have offered to intercede in negotiations,\\nincluding a young man who will identify himself only as \"Bill\" and\\nclaims to be the \"MS-iah\".\\n\\nFormer members of the cult, some only recently deprogrammed, speak\\nhesitantly of their former lives, including being forced to work\\n20-hour days, and subsisting on Jolt and Twinkies.  There were\\nfrequent lectures in which they were indoctrinated into a theory of\\n\"interpersonal computing\" which rejects traditional roles.\\n\\nLate-night vigils on Chesapeake Drive are taking their toll on\\nfederal marshals.

Below is a very short\\ndescription of the process which we use; if you have further questions,\\nfeel free to poke me via e-mail.\\n\\n================================================================\\n*ASSUME: locally smooth distortion\\n\\n0) Compute the Delaunay Triangulation of your (x,y) points.  This\\n   defines the set of neighbors for each point.  If your data are\\n   not naturally convex, you may have very long edges on the convex hull.\\n   Consider deleting these edges.\\n\\n1) Now, there are two goals:\\n\\n    a) move the DistortedData(x,y) to the Reference(x,y)\\n    b) keep the Length(e) (as measured from the current (x,y)\\'s)\\n       as close as possible to the DigitizedLength(e) (as measured \\n       using the digitized (x,y)\\'s).\\n\\n2) For every point, compute a displacement based on a) and b).  For\\n   example:\\n\\n    a) For (x,y) points for which you know the Reference(x,y), you\\n       can move alpha0*(Reference(x,y) - Current(x,y)).   This will\\n       slowly move the DistortedReference(x,y) towards the\\n       Reference(x,y). \\n    b) For all other points, examine the current length of each edge.\\n       For each edge, compute a displacement which would make that edge\\n       the correct length (where \"correct\" is the DigitizedLength). \\n       Take the vector sum of these edge displacements, and move the\\n       point alpha1*SumOfEdgeDisplacements.  This will keep the\\n       triangulated mesh consistent with your Digitized mesh.\\n\\n3) Iterate 2) until you are happy (for example, no point moves very much).\\n\\nalpha0 and alpha1 need to be determined by experimentation.   Consider\\nhow much you believe the Reference(x,y) - i.e., do you absolutely insist\\non the final points exactly matching the References, or do you want to\\nbalance some error in matching the Reference against changes in length\\nof the edges.\\n\\nWARNING: there are a couple of geometric invariants which must be\\nobserved (essentially, you can\\'t allow the convex hull to change, and\\nyou can\\'t allow triangles to \"fold over\" neighboring triangles.  Both of\\nthese can be handled either by special case checks on the motion of\\nindividual points, or by periodically re-triangulating the points (using \\nthe current positions - but still calculating DigitizedLength from the\\noriginal positions.  When we first did this, the triangulation time was\\nprohibitive, so we only did it once.  If I were motivated to try and\\nchange code that has been working in production mode for 5 years, I\\n*might* go back and re-triangulate on every iteration.

How do I become an astronaut?\\n\\n    A. We will assume you mean a NASA astronaut, since it\\'s probably\\n    impossible for a non-Russian to get into the cosmonaut corps (paying\\n    passengers are not professional cosmonauts), and the other nations have\\n    so few astronauts (and fly even fewer) that you\\'re better off hoping to\\n    win a lottery. Becoming a shuttle pilot requires lots of fast-jet\\n    experience, which means a military flying career; forget that unless you\\n    want to do it anyway. So you want to become a shuttle \"mission\\n    specialist\".\\n\\n    If you aren\\'t a US citizen, become one; that is a must.  After that,\\n    the crucial thing to remember is that the demand for such jobs vastly\\n    exceeds the supply.  NASA\\'s problem is not finding qualified people,\\n    but thinning the lineup down to manageable length.\\tIt is not enough\\n    to be qualified; you must avoid being *dis*qualified for any reason,\\n    many of them in principle quite irrelevant to the job.\\n\\n    Get a Ph.D.  Specialize in something that involves getting your hands\\n    dirty with equipment, not just paper and pencil.  Forget computer\\n    programming entirely; it will be done from the ground for the fore-\\n    seeable future.  Degree(s) in one field plus work experience in\\n    another seems to be a frequent winner.\\n\\n    Be in good physical condition, with good eyesight.\\t(DO NOT get a\\n    radial keratomy or similar hack to improve your vision; nobody knows\\n    what sudden pressure changes would do to RKed eyes, and long-term\\n    effects are poorly understood.  For that matter, avoid any other\\n    significant medical unknowns.)  If you can pass a jet-pilot physical,\\n    you should be okay; if you can\\'t, your chances are poor.\\n\\n    Practise public speaking, and be conservative and conformist in\\n    appearance and actions; you\\'ve got a tough selling job ahead, trying\\n    to convince a cautious, conservative selection committee that you\\n    are better than hundreds of other applicants.  (And, also, that you\\n    will be a credit to NASA after you are hired:  public relations is\\n    a significant part of the job, and NASA\\'s image is very prim and\\n    proper.)  The image you want is squeaky-clean workaholic yuppie.\\n    Remember also that you will need a security clearance at some point,\\n    and Security considers everybody guilty until proven innocent.\\n    Keep your nose clean.\\n\\n    Get a pilot\\'s license and make flying your number one hobby;\\n    experienced pilots are known to be favored even for non-pilot jobs.\\n\\n    Work for NASA; of 45 astronauts selected between 1984 and 1988,\\n    43 were military or NASA employees, and the remaining two were\\n    a NASA consultant and Mae Jemison (the first black female astronaut).\\n    If you apply from outside NASA and miss, but they offer you a job\\n    at NASA, ***TAKE IT***; sometimes in the past this has meant \"you\\n    do look interesting but we want to know you a bit better first\".\\n\\n    Think space:  they want highly motivated people, so lose no chance\\n    to demonstrate motivation.\\n\\n    Keep trying.

NASA is now accepting on a\\n    continuous basis and plans to select astronaut candidates as needed.\\n\\n    Persons from both the civilian sector and the military services will be\\n    considered.\\n\\n    All positions are located at the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in\\n    Houston, Texas, and will involved a 1-year training and evaluation\\n    program.\\n\\n    Space Shuttle Program Description\\n    ---------------------------------\\n\\n    The numerous successful flights of the Space Shuttle have demonstrated\\n    that operation and experimental investigations in space are becoming\\n    routine. The Space Shuttle Orbiter is launched into, and maneuvers in\\n    the Earth orbit performing missions lastling up to 30 days. It then\\n    returns to earth and is ready for another flight with payloads and\\n    flight crew.\\n\\n    The Orbiter performs a variety of orbital missions including deployment\\n    and retrieval of satellites, service of existing satellites, operation\\n    of specialized laboratories (astronomy, earth sciences, materials\\n    processing, manufacturing), and other operations. These missions will\\n    eventually include the development and servicing of a permanent space\\n    station. The Orbiter also provides a staging capability for using higher\\n    orbits than can be achieved by the Orbiter itself. Users of the Space\\n    Shuttle\\'s capabilities are both domestic and foreign and include\\n    government agencies and private industries.\\n\\n    The crew normally consists of five people - the commander, the pilot,\\n    and three mission specialists. On occasion additional crew members are\\n    assigned. The commander, pilot, and mission specialists are NASA\\n    astronauts.\\n\\n    Pilot Astronaut\\n\\n    Pilot astronauts server as both Space Shuttle commanders and pilots.\\n    During flight the commander has onboard responsibility for the vehicle,\\n    crew, mission success and safety in flight. The pilot assists the\\n    commander in controlling and operating the vehicle. In addition, the\\n    pilot may assist in the deployment and retrieval of satellites utilizing\\n    the remote manipulator system, in extra-vehicular activities, and other\\n    payload operations.\\n\\n    Mission Specialist Astronaut\\n\\n    Mission specialist astronauts, working with the commander and pilot,\\n    have overall responsibility for the coordination of Shuttle operations\\n    in the areas of crew activity planning, consumables usage, and\\n    experiment and payload operations. Mission specialists are required to\\n    have a detailed knowledge of Shuttle systems, as well as detailed\\n    knowledge of the operational characteristics, mission requirements and\\n    objectives, and supporting systems and equipment for each of the\\n    experiments to be conducted on their assigned missions. Mission\\n    specialists will perform extra-vehicular activities, payload handling\\n    using the remote manipulator system, and perform or assist in specific\\n    experimental operations.\\n\\n    Astronaut Candidate Program\\n    ===========================\\n\\n    Basic Qualification Requirements\\n    --------------------------------\\n\\n    Applicants MUST meet the following minimum requirements prior to\\n    submitting an application.\\n\\n    Mission Specialist Astronaut Candidate:\\n\\n    1.

When NASA\\n    decides to select additional astronaut candidates, consideration will be\\n    given only to those applications on hand on the date of decision is\\n    made. Applications received after that date will be retained and\\n    considered for the next selection. Applicants will be notified annually\\n    of the opportunity to update their applications and to indicate\\n    continued interest in being considered for the program. Those applicants\\n    who do not update their applications annually will be dropped from\\n    consideration, and their applications will not be retained. After the\\n    preliminary screening of applications, additional information may be\\n    requested for some applicants, and person listed on the application as\\n    supervisors and references may be contacted.\\n\\n    Active Duty Military\\n\\n    Active duty military personnel must submit applications to their\\n    respective military service and not directly to NASA. Application\\n    procedures will be disseminated by each service.\\n\\n    Selection\\n    ---------\\n\\n    Personal interviews and thorough medical evaluations will be required\\n    for both civilian and military applicants under final consideration.\\n    Once final selections have been made, all applicants who were considered\\n    will be notified of the outcome of the process.\\n\\n    Selection rosters established through this process may be used for the\\n    selection of additional candidates during a one year period following\\n    their establishment.\\n\\n    General Program Requirements\\n\\n    Selected applicants will be designated Astronaut Candidates and will be\\n    assigned to the Astronaut Office at the Johnson Space Center, Houston,\\n    Texas. The astronaut candidates will undergo a 1 year training and\\n    evaluation period during which time they will be assigned technical or\\n    scientific responsibilities allowing them to contribute substantially to\\n    ongoing programs. They will also participate in the basic astronaut\\n    training program which is designed to develop the knowledge and skills\\n    required for formal mission training upon selection for a flight. Pilot\\n    astronaut candidates will maintain proficiency in NASA aircraft during\\n    their candidate period.\\n\\n    Applicants should be aware that selection as an astronaut candidate does\\n    not insure selection as an astronaut. Final selection as an astronaut\\n    will depend on satisfactory completion of the 1 year training and\\n    evaluation period. Civilian candidates who successfully complete the\\n    training and evaluation and are selected as astronauts will become\\n    permanent Federal employees and will be expected to remain with NASA for\\n    a period of at least five years. Civilian candidates who are not\\n    selected as astronauts may be placed in other positions within NASA\\n    depending upon Agency requirements and manpower constraints at that\\n    time. Successful military candidates will be detailed to NASA for a\\n    specified tour of duty.\\n\\n    NASA has an affirmative action program goal of having qualified\\n    minorities and women among those qualified as astronaut candidates.\\n    Therefore, qualified minorities and women are encouraged to apply.\\n\\n    Pay and Benefits\\n    ----------------\\n\\n    Civilians\\n\\n    Salaries for civilian astronaut candidates are based on the Federal\\n    Governments General Schedule pay scales for grades GS-11 through GS-14,\\n    and are set in accordance with each individuals academic achievements\\n    and experience.\\n\\n    Other benefits include vacation and sick leave, a retirement plan, and\\n    participation in group health and life insurance plans.\\n\\n    Military\\n\\n    Selected military personnel will be detailed to the Johnson Space Center\\n    but will remain in an active duty status for pay, benefits, leave, and\\n    other similar military matters.\\n\\n\\nNEXT: FAQ #15/15 - Orbital and Planetary Launch Services\\n',\n",

       "  'From: rws@cs.arizona.edu (Ronald W. Schmidt)\\nSubject: outlining of spline surface\\nKeywords: spline rasterization\\nLines: 38\\n\\n\\n\\tAbout a year ago I started work on a problem that appeared to\\nbe very simple and turned out to be quite difficult.  I am wondering if\\nanyone on the net has seen this problem and (hopefully) some published \\nsolutions to it.\\n\\n\\tThe problem is to draw an outline of a surface defined by two\\nroughly parallel cubic splines.  For inputs the problem essentially\\nstarts with two sets of points where each set of points is on the \\nedge of an object which we treat as two dimensional, i.e. only extant\\nbetween the edges, but which exists in three dimensional space.  To draw \\nthe object we \\n\\n1) fit a cubic spline through the points.  Each spline is effectively\\n\\tcomputed as a sequence of line segments approximating the\\n        curve.  Each spline has an equal number of segments.  We assume\\n\\tthat the nth segment along each spline is roughly, but not\\n\\texactly, the same distance along each spline by any reasonable\\n\\tmeasure.\\n2) Take each segment (n) along each spline and match it to the nth segment\\n\\tof the opposing spline.  Use the pair of segments to form two\\n\\ttriangles which will be filled in to color the surface.\\n3) Depth sort the triangles\\n4) Take each triangle in sorted order, project onto a 2D pixmap, draw\\n\\tand color the triangle.  Take the edge of the triangle that is\\n\\talong the edge of the surface and draw a line along that edge\\n\\tcolored with a special \"edge color\"\\n\\n\\tIt is the edge coloring in step 4 that is at the heart of the\\nproblem.  The idea is to effectively outline the edge of the surface.\\nThe net result however generally has lots of breaks and gaps in\\nthe edge of the surface.  The reasons for this are fairly complicated.\\nThey involve both rasterization problems and problems resulting\\nfrom the projecting the splines.  If anything about this problem\\nsounds familiar we would appreciate knowing about other work in this\\narea.\\n\\n-Thanks\\n',\n",

After less than a week, I took it back in\\ndisgust and exchanged it for the cheesy no-name U-lock.\\n\\nFirst, the Krypto cable I bought is not made by Kryptonite, is not covered by\\nthe Kryptonite guarantee, and doesn\\'t even approach Kryptonite standards of\\nquality and quality assurance.

Everyone,\\n\\nBecause no one has touched the problem I posted last week, I guess\\nmy question was not so clear. Now I\\'d like to describe it in detail:\\n\\nThe offset of an ellipse is the locus of the center of a circle which\\nrolls on the ellipse. In other words, the distance between the ellipse\\nand its offset is same everywhere.\\n\\nThis problem comes from the geometric measurement when a probe is used.\\nThe tip of the probe is a ball and the computer just outputs the\\npositions of the ball\\'s center. Is the offset of an ellipse still\\nan ellipse? The answer is no! Ironically, DMIS - an American Indutrial\\nStandard says it is ellipse. So almost all the software which was\\nimplemented on the base of DMIS was wrong. The software was also sold\\ninternationaly. Imagine, how many people have or will suffer from this bug!!!\\nHow many qualified parts with ellipse were/will be discarded? And most\\nimportantly, how many defective parts with ellipse are/will be used?\\n\\nI was employed as a consultant by a company in Los Angeles last year\\nto specially solve this problem. I spent two months on analysis of this\\nproblem and six months on programming. Now my solution (nonlinear)\\nis not ideal because I can only reconstruct an ellipse from its entire\\nor half offset. It is very difficult to find the original ellipse from\\na quarter or a segment of its offset because the method I used is not\\nanalytical. I am now wondering if I didn\\'t touch the base and make things\\ncomplicated. Please give me a hint.\\n\\nI know you may argue this is not a CG problem. You are right, it is not.\\nHowever, so many people involved in the problem \"sphere from 4 poits\".\\nWhy not an ellipse? And why not its offset?\\n\\nPlease post here and let the others share our interests \\n(I got several emails from our netters, they said they need the\\nsummary of the answers).\\n\\nYeh\\nUSC\\n',\n",

Polymenakos) writes:\\n\\n> Well, ZUMABOT claims just the opposite: That Greeks are not allowing\\n>Turks to exit the country. Now, explain this: The number of Turks in\\n>Thrace has steadily risen from 50,000 in 23 to 80,000, while the Greeks of\\n\\nDr. Goebels thought that a lie repeated enough times could finally \\nbe believed. I have been observing that 'Poly' has been practicing \\nGoebels' rule quite loyally. 'Poly's audience is mostly made of Greeks \\nwho are not allowed to listen to Turkish news. However, in today's \\ninformed world Greek propagandists can only fool themselves. For \\ninstance, those who lived in 1974 will remember the TV news they \\nwatched and the newspapers they read and the younger generation can \\nread the American newspapers of July and August 1974 to find out what \\nreally happened. \\n\\nThere are in Turkiye the Greek Hospital, The Greek Girls' Lycee \\nAlumni Association, the Principo Islands Greek Benevolent Society, \\nthe Greek Medical Foundation, the Principo Greek Orphanage Foundation, \\nthe Yovakimion Greek Girls' Lycee Foundation, and the Fener Greek \\nMen's Lycee Foundation.  \\n\\nAs for Greece, the longstanding use of the adjective 'Turkish' \\nin titles and on signboards is prohibited. The Greek courts \\nhave ordered the closure of the Turkish Teachers' Association, \\nthe Komotini Turkish Youth Association and the Ksanti \\nTurkish Association on grounds that there are no Turks\\nin Western Thrace. Such community associations had been \\nactive until 1984. But they were first told to remove\\nthe word 'Turkish' on their buildings and on their official\\npapers and then eventually close down. This is also the \\nfinal verdict (November 4, 1987) of the Greek High Court.\\n\\nIn the city of Komotini, a former Greek Parliamentarian of Turkish\\nparentage, was sentenced recently to 18 months of imprisonment\\nwith no right to appeal, just for saying outloud that he was\\nof Turkish descent. This duly-elected ethnic Turkish official\\nwas also deprived of his political rights for a period of three \\nyears. Each one of these barbaric acts seems to be none other than \\na vehicle, used by the Greek governments, to cover-up their inferiority \\ncomplex they display, vis-a-vis, the people of Turkiye. \\n\\nThe Agreement on the Exchange of Minorities uses the term 'Turks,' \\nwhich demonstrates what is actually meant by the previous reference \\nto 'Muslims.' The fact that the Greek governments also mention the \\nexistence of a few thousand non-Turkish Muslims does not change the \\nessential reality that there lives in Western Thrace a much bigger \\nTurkish minority. The 'Pomaks' are also a Muslim people, whom all the \\nthree nations (Bulgarians, Turks, and Greeks) consider as part of \\nthemselves. Do you know how the Muslim Turkish minority was organized \\naccording to the agreements? Poor 'Poly.'\\n\\nIt also proves that the Turkish people are trapped in Greece \\nand the Greek people are free to settle anywhere in the world.\\nThe Greek authorities deny even the existence of a Turkish\\nminority. They pursue the same denial in connection with \\nthe Macedonians of Greece. Talk about oppression. In addition,\\nin 1980 the 'democratic' Greek Parliament passed Law No. 1091,\\nvirtually taking over the administration of the vakiflar and\\nother charitable trusts. They have ceased to be self-supporting\\nreligious and cultural entities. Talk about fascism. The Greek \\ngovernments are attempting to appoint the muftus, irrespective\\nof the will of the Turkish minority, as state official. Although\\nthe Orthodox Church has full authority in similar matters in\\nGreece, the Muslim Turkish minority will have no say in electing\\nits religious leaders. Talk about democracy.\\n\\nThe government of Greece has recently destroyed an Islamic \\nconvention in Komotini. Such destruction, which reflects an \\nattitude against the Muslim Turkish cultural heritage, is a \\nviolation of the Lausanne Convention as well as the 'so-called' \\nGreek Constitution, which is supposed to guarantee the protection \\nof historical monuments. \\n\\nThe government of Greece, on the other hand, is building new \\nchurches in remote villages as a complementary step toward \\nHellenizing the region.\\n\\nAnd you pondered. Sidiropoulos, the president of the Macedonian Human \\nRights Committee, became the latest victim of a tactic long used by \\nthe Greeks to silence critics of policies of forced assimilation \\nof the Macedonian minority. A forestry official by occupation, \\nSidiropoulos has been sent to 'internal exile' on the island of \\nKefalonia, hundreds of kilometers away from his native Florina. \\nHis employer, the Florina City Council, asked him to depart in \\n24 hours. The Greek authorities are trying to punish him for his \\ninvolvement in Copenhagen. He returned to Florina by his own choice \\nand remains without a job. \\n\\nHelsinki Watch, a well-known Human Rights group, had been investigating \\nthe plight of the Turkish Minority in Greece. In August 1990, their \\nfindings were published in a report titled \\n\\n 'Destroying Ethnic Identity: Turks of Greece.'\\n\\nThe report confirmed gross violations of the Human Rights of the \\nTurkish minority by the Greek authorities. It says for instance, \\nthe Greek government recently destroyed an Islamic convent in \\nKomotini. Such destruction, which reflects an attitude against \\nthe Muslim Turkish cultural heritage, is a violation of the \\nLausanne Convention. \\n\\nThe Turkish cemeteries in the village of Vafeika and in Pinarlik\\nwere attacked, and tombstones were broken. The cemetery in\\nKarotas was razed by bulldozers.\\n\\nShall I go on? Why not? The people of Turkiye are not going \\nto take human rights lessons from the Greek Government. The \\ndiscussion of human rights violations in Greece does not \\nstop at the Greek frontier. In several following articles \\nI shall dwell on and expose the Greek treatment of Turks\\nin Western Thrace and the Aegean Macedonians.\\n\\nIt has been reported that the Greek Cypriot administration \\nhas an intense desire for arms and that Greece has made \\nplans to supply it with the tanks and armored vehicles it \\nhas to destroy in accordance with the agreement reached on \\nconventional arms reductions in Europe. Meanwhile, Greek \\nand Greek Cypriot officials are reported to have planned \\nto take ostentatious measures aimed at camouflaging the \\ntransfer of these tanks and armored vehicles to southern \\nCyprus, a process that will conflict with the spirit of \\nthe agreement on conventional arms reduction in Europe.\\n\\nAn acceptable method may certainly be found when there\\nis a will. But we know of various kinds of violent\\nbehaviors ranging from physical attacks to the burning\\nof buildings. The rugs at the Amfia village mosque were \\ndragged out to the front of the building and burnt there. \\nShots were fired on the mosque in the village of Aryana.\\n\\nNow wait, there is more.\\n\\n  'Greek Atrocities in the Vilayet of Smyrna (May to July 1919), Inedited\\n  Documents and Evidence of English and French Officers,' Published by\\n  The Permanent Bureau of the Turkish Congress at Lausanne, Lausanne,\\n  Imprimerie Petter, Giesser & Held, Caroline, 5 (1919).\\n\\n  pages 82-83:\\n\\n<< 1.

They habe been kept under occupation by Israel since 1967\\nwithout civil and political rights. \\n\\nIt is a fact that Gazans live in their own country, Palestine. Gaza is\\nnot a foriegn country. Nor is TelAviv, Jaffa, Askalon, BeerSheba foreign\\ncountry for Gazans. All these places are occupied as far as Palestinians\\nare concerned and as far as common sense has it. \\n\\nIt is a fact that Zionists deny Gazans equal rights as Israeli citizens\\nand the right to determine by themsevles their government. When Zionists\\nwill begin to consider Gazans as human beings who deserve the same\\nrights as themselves, there will be hope for peace. Not before.\\n\\nSomebody mentioned that Gaza is 'foreign country' and therefore Israel\\nis entitled to close its borders to Gaza. In this case, Gaza should be\\nentitled to reciprocate, and deny Israeli civilians and military personnel\\nto enter the area. As the relation is not symmetrical, but that of a master\\nand slave, the label 'foreign country' is inaccurate and misleading.\\n\\nTo close off 700,000 people in the Strip, deny them means of subsistence\\nand means of defending themselves, is a collective punishment and a\\ncrime. It is neither justifiable nor legal. It just reflects the abyss \\nto which Israeli society has degraded. \\n\\nI would like to ask any of those who heap foul langauge on me to explain\\nwhy Israel denies Gazans who were born and brought up in Jaffa to return\\nand live there ? Would they be allowed to, if they converted to Judaism ?\\nIs their right to live in their former town depdendent upon their\\nreligion or ethnic origin ?

Matthew\\n    Wiener (weemba@libra.wistar.upenn.edu) contributed the section on\\n    Voyager, and the section on Sakigake was obtained from ISAS material\\n    posted by Yoshiro Yamada (yamada@yscvax.ysc.go.jp).\\n\\nUS PLANETARY MISSIONS\\n\\n\\n    MARINER (VENUS, MARS, & MERCURY FLYBYS AND ORBITERS)\\n\\n    MARINER 1, the first U.S. attempt to send a spacecraft to Venus, failed\\n    minutes after launch in 1962. The guidance instructions from the ground\\n    stopped reaching the rocket due to a problem with its antenna, so the\\n    onboard computer took control. However, there turned out to be a bug in\\n    the guidance software, and the rocket promptly went off course, so the\\n    Range Safety Officer destroyed it. Although the bug is sometimes claimed\\n    to have been an incorrect FORTRAN DO statement, it was actually a\\n    transcription error in which the bar (indicating smoothing) was omitted\\n    from the expression \"R-dot-bar sub n\" (nth smoothed value of derivative\\n    of radius). This error led the software to treat normal minor variations\\n    of velocity as if they were serious, leading to incorrect compensation.\\n\\n    MARINER 2 became the first successful probe to flyby Venus in December\\n    of 1962, and it returned information which confirmed that Venus is a\\n    very hot (800 degrees Fahrenheit, now revised to 900 degrees F.) world\\n    with a cloud-covered atmosphere composed primarily of carbon dioxide\\n    (sulfuric acid was later confirmed in 1978).\\n\\n    MARINER 3, launched on November 5, 1964, was lost when its protective\\n    shroud failed to eject as the craft was placed into interplanetary\\n    space. Unable to collect the Sun\\'s energy for power from its solar\\n    panels, the probe soon died when its batteries ran out and is now in\\n    solar orbit. It was intended for a Mars flyby with MARINER 4.\\n\\n    MARINER 4, the sister probe to MARINER 3, did reach Mars in 1965 and\\n    took the first close-up images of the Martian surface (22 in all) as it\\n    flew by the planet. The probe found a cratered world with an atmosphere\\n    much thinner than previously thought. Many scientists concluded from\\n    this preliminary scan that Mars was a \"dead\" world in both the\\n    geological and biological sense.\\n\\n    MARINER 5 was sent to Venus in 1967. It reconfirmed the data on that\\n    planet collected five years earlier by MARINER 2, plus the information\\n    that Venus\\' atmospheric pressure at its surface is at least 90 times\\n    that of Earth\\'s, or the equivalent of being 3,300 feet under the surface\\n    of an ocean.\\n\\n    MARINER 6 and 7 were sent to Mars in 1969 and expanded upon the work\\n    done by MARINER 4 four years earlier. However, they failed to take away\\n    the concept of Mars as a \"dead\" planet, first made from the basic\\n    measurements of MARINER 4.\\n\\n    MARINER 8 ended up in the Atlantic Ocean in 1971 when the rocket\\n    launcher autopilot failed.\\n\\n    MARINER 9, the sister probe to MARINER 8, became the first craft to\\n    orbit Mars in 1971. It returned information on the Red Planet that no\\n    other probe had done before, revealing huge volcanoes on the Martian\\n    surface, as well as giant canyon systems, and evidence that water once\\n    flowed across the planet. The probe also took the first detailed closeup\\n    images of Mars\\' two small moons, Phobos and Deimos.\\n\\n    MARINER 10 used Venus as a gravity assist to Mercury in 1974. The probe\\n    did return the first close-up images of the Venusian atmosphere in\\n    ultraviolet, revealing previously unseen details in the cloud cover,\\n    plus the fact that the entire cloud system circles the planet in four\\n    Earth days. MARINER 10 eventually made three flybys of Mercury from 1974\\n    to 1975 before running out of attitude control gas. The probe revealed\\n    Mercury as a heavily cratered world with a mass much greater than\\n    thought. This would seem to indicate that Mercury has an iron core which\\n    makes up 75 percent of the entire planet.\\n\\n\\n    PIONEER (MOON, SUN, VENUS, JUPITER, and SATURN FLYBYS AND ORBITERS)\\n\\n    PIONEER 1 through 3 failed to meet their main objective - to photograph\\n    the Moon close-up - but they did reach far enough into space to provide\\n    new information on the area between Earth and the Moon, including new\\n    data on the Van Allen radiation belts circling Earth. All three craft\\n    had failures with their rocket launchers. PIONEER 1 was launched on\\n    October 11, 1958, PIONEER 2 on November 8, and PIONEER 3 on December 6.\\n\\n    PIONEER 4 was a Moon probe which missed the Moon and became the first\\n    U.S. spacecraft to orbit the Sun in 1959. PIONEER 5 was originally\\n    designed to flyby Venus, but the mission was scaled down and it instead\\n    studied the interplanetary environment between Venus and Earth out to\\n    36.2 million kilometers in 1960, a record until MARINER 2. PIONEER 6\\n    through 9 were placed into solar orbit from 1965 to 1968: PIONEER 6, 7,\\n    and 8 are still transmitting information at this time. PIONEER E (would\\n    have been number 10) suffered a launch failure in 1969.\\n\\n    PIONEER 10 became the first spacecraft to flyby Jupiter in 1973. PIONEER\\n    11 followed it in 1974, and then went on to become the first probe to\\n    study Saturn in 1979. Both vehicles should continue to function through\\n    1995 and are heading off into interstellar space, the first craft ever\\n    to do so.\\n\\n    PIONEER Venus 1 (1978) (also known as PIONEER Venus Orbiter, or PIONEER\\n    12) burned up in the Venusian atmosphere on October 8, 1992. PVO made\\n    the first radar studies of the planet\\'s surface via probe. PIONEER Venus\\n    2 (also known as PIONEER 13) sent four small probes into the atmosphere\\n    in December of 1978. The main spacecraft bus burned up high in the\\n    atmosphere, while the four probes descended by parachute towards the\\n    surface. Though none were expected to survive to the surface, the Day\\n    probe did make it and transmitted for 67.5 minutes on the ground before\\n    its batteries failed.\\n\\n\\n    RANGER (LUNAR LANDER AND IMPACT MISSIONS)\\n\\n    RANGER 1 and 2 were test probes for the RANGER lunar impact series. They\\n    were meant for high Earth orbit testing in 1961, but rocket problems\\n    left them in useless low orbits which quickly decayed.\\n\\n    RANGER 3, launched on January 26, 1962, was intended to land an\\n    instrument capsule on the surface of the Moon, but problems during the\\n    launch caused the probe to miss the Moon and head into solar orbit.\\n    RANGER 3 did try to take some images of the Moon as it flew by, but the\\n    camera was unfortunately aimed at deep space during the attempt.\\n\\n    RANGER 4, launched April 23, 1962, had the same purpose as RANGER 3, but\\n    suffered technical problems enroute and crashed on the lunar farside,\\n    the first U.S. probe to reach the Moon, albeit without returning data.\\n\\n    RANGER 5, launched October 18, 1962 and similar to RANGER 3 and 4, lost\\n    all solar panel and battery power enroute and eventually missed the Moon\\n    and drifted off into solar orbit.\\n\\n    RANGER 6 through 9 had more modified lunar missions: They were to send\\n    back live images of the lunar surface as they headed towards an impact\\n    with the Moon. RANGER 6 failed this objective in 1964 when its cameras\\n    did not operate. RANGER 7 through 9 performed well, becoming the first\\n    U.S. lunar probes to return thousands of lunar images through 1965.\\n\\n\\n    LUNAR ORBITER (LUNAR SURFACE PHOTOGRAPHY)\\n\\n    LUNAR ORBITER 1 through 5 were designed to orbit the Moon and image\\n    various sites being studied as landing areas for the manned APOLLO\\n    missions of 1969-1972. The probes also contributed greatly to our\\n    understanding of lunar surface features, particularly the lunar farside.\\n    All five probes of the series, launched from 1966 to 1967, were\\n    essentially successful in their missions. They were the first U.S.\\n    probes to orbit the Moon. All LOs were eventually crashed into the lunar\\n    surface to avoid interference with the manned APOLLO missions.\\n\\n\\n    SURVEYOR (LUNAR SOFT LANDERS)\\n\\n    The SURVEYOR series were designed primarily to see if an APOLLO lunar\\n    module could land on the surface of the Moon without sinking into the\\n    soil (before this time, it was feared by some that the Moon was covered\\n    in great layers of dust, which would not support a heavy landing\\n    vehicle). SURVEYOR was successful in proving that the lunar surface was\\n    strong enough to hold up a spacecraft from 1966 to 1968.\\n\\n    Only SURVEYOR 2 and 4 were unsuccessful missions. The rest became the\\n    first U.S. probes to soft land on the Moon, taking thousands of images\\n    and scooping the soil for analysis. APOLLO 12 landed 600 feet from\\n    SURVEYOR 3 in 1969 and returned parts of the craft to Earth. SURVEYOR 7,\\n    the last of the series, was a purely scientific mission which explored\\n    the Tycho crater region in 1968.\\n\\n\\n    VIKING (MARS ORBITERS AND LANDERS)\\n\\n    VIKING 1 was launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida on August 20, 1975 on\\n    a TITAN 3E-CENTAUR D1 rocket. The probe went into Martian orbit on June\\n    19, 1976, and the lander set down on the western slopes of Chryse\\n    Planitia on July 20, 1976. It soon began its programmed search for\\n    Martian micro-organisms (there is still debate as to whether the probes\\n    found life there or not), and sent back incredible color panoramas of\\n    its surroundings. One thing scientists learned was that Mars\\' sky was\\n    pinkish in color, not dark blue as they originally thought (the sky is\\n    pink due to sunlight reflecting off the reddish dust particles in the\\n    thin atmosphere). The lander set down among a field of red sand and\\n    boulders stretching out as far as its cameras could image.\\n\\n    The VIKING 1 orbiter kept functioning until August 7, 1980, when it ran\\n    out of attitude-control propellant. The lander was switched into a\\n    weather-reporting mode, where it had been hoped it would keep\\n    functioning through 1994; but after November 13, 1982, an errant command\\n    had been sent to the lander accidentally telling it to shut down until\\n    further orders. Communication was never regained again, despite the\\n    engineers\\' efforts through May of 1983.\\n\\n    An interesting side note: VIKING 1\\'s lander has been designated the\\n    Thomas A. Mutch Memorial Station in honor of the late leader of the\\n    lander imaging team. The National Air and Space Museum in Washington,\\n    D.C. is entrusted with the safekeeping of the Mutch Station Plaque until\\n    it can be attached to the lander by a manned expedition.\\n\\n    VIKING 2 was launched on September 9, 1975, and arrived in Martian orbit\\n    on August 7, 1976. The lander touched down on September 3, 1976 in\\n    Utopia Planitia. It accomplished essentially the same tasks as its\\n    sister lander, with the exception that its seisometer worked, recording\\n    one marsquake. The orbiter had a series of attitude-control gas leaks in\\n    1978, which prompted it being shut down that July. The lander was shut\\n    down on April 12, 1980.\\n\\n    The orbits of both VIKING orbiters should decay around 2025.\\n\\n\\n    VOYAGER (OUTER PLANET FLYBYS)\\n\\n    VOYAGER 1 was launched September 5, 1977, and flew past Jupiter on March\\n    5, 1979 and by Saturn on November 13, 1980. VOYAGER 2 was launched\\n    August 20, 1977 (before VOYAGER 1), and flew by Jupiter on August 7,\\n    1979, by Saturn on August 26, 1981, by Uranus on January 24, 1986, and\\n    by Neptune on August 8, 1989. VOYAGER 2 took advantage of a rare\\n    once-every-189-years alignment to slingshot its way from outer planet to\\n    outer planet. VOYAGER 1 could, in principle, have headed towards Pluto,\\n    but JPL opted for the sure thing of a Titan close up.\\n\\n    Between the two probes, our knowledge of the 4 giant planets, their\\n    satellites, and their rings has become immense. VOYAGER 1&2 discovered\\n    that Jupiter has complicated atmospheric dynamics, lightning and\\n    aurorae. Three new satellites were discovered. Two of the major\\n    surprises were that Jupiter has rings and that Io has active sulfurous\\n    volcanoes, with major effects on the Jovian magnetosphere.\\n\\n    When the two probes reached Saturn, they discovered over 1000 ringlets\\n    and 7 satellites, including the predicted shepherd satellites that keep\\n    the rings stable. The weather was tame compared with Jupiter: massive\\n    jet streams with minimal variance (a 33-year great white spot/band cycle\\n    is known). Titan\\'s atmosphere was smoggy. Mimas\\' appearance was\\n    startling: one massive impact crater gave it the Death Star appearance.\\n    The big surprise here was the stranger aspects of the rings. Braids,\\n    kinks, and spokes were both unexpected and difficult to explain.\\n\\n    VOYAGER 2, thanks to heroic engineering and programming efforts,\\n    continued the mission to Uranus and Neptune. Uranus itself was highly\\n    monochromatic in appearance. One oddity was that its magnetic axis was\\n    found to be highly skewed from the already completely skewed rotational\\n    axis, giving Uranus a peculiar magnetosphere. Icy channels were found on\\n    Ariel, and Miranda was a bizarre patchwork of different terrains. 10\\n    satellites and one more ring were discovered.\\n\\n    In contrast to Uranus, Neptune was found to have rather active weather,\\n    including numerous cloud features. The ring arcs turned out to be bright\\n    patches on one ring. Two other rings, and 6 other satellites, were\\n    discovered. Neptune\\'s magnetic axis was also skewed. Triton had a\\n    canteloupe appearance and geysers. (What\\'s liquid at 38K?)\\n\\n    The two VOYAGERs are expected to last for about two more decades. Their\\n    on-target journeying gives negative evidence about possible planets\\n    beyond Pluto. Their next major scientific discovery should be the\\n    location of the heliopause.\\n\\n\\nSOVIET PLANETARY MISSIONS\\n\\n    Since there have been so many Soviet probes to the Moon, Venus, and\\n    Mars, I will highlight only the primary missions:\\n\\n\\n    SOVIET LUNAR PROBES\\n\\n    LUNA 1 - Lunar impact attempt in 1959, missed Moon and became first\\n\\t     craft in solar orbit.\\n    LUNA 2 - First craft to impact on lunar surface in 1959.\\n    LUNA 3 - Took first images of lunar farside in 1959.\\n    ZOND 3 - Took first images of lunar farside in 1965 since LUNA 3.

Flyby buses went on\\n\\t     to become first spacecraft to study Comet Halley close-up in\\n\\t     March of 1986.\\n\\n\\n    SOVIET MARS PROBES\\n\\n    MARS 1 - First acknowledged Mars probe in 1962. Transmissions ceased\\n\\t     enroute the following year.\\n    ZOND 2 - First possible attempt to place a lander capsule on Martian\\n\\t     surface. Probe signals ceased enroute in 1965.\\n    MARS 2 - First Soviet Mars probe to land - albeit crash - on Martian\\n\\t     surface. Orbiter section first Soviet probe to circle the Red\\n\\t     Planet in 1971.\\n    MARS 3 - First successful soft landing on Martian surface, but lander\\n\\t     signals ceased after 90 seconds in 1971.\\n    MARS 4 - Attempt at orbiting Mars in 1974, braking rockets failed to\\n\\t     fire, probe went on into solar orbit.\\n    MARS 5 - First fully successful Soviet Mars mission, orbiting Mars in\\n\\t     1974. Returned images of Martian surface comparable to U.S.\\n\\t     probe MARINER 9.\\n    MARS 6 - Landing attempt in 1974. Lander crashed into the surface.\\n    MARS 7 - Lander missed Mars completely in 1974, went into a solar orbit\\n\\t     with its flyby bus.\\n    PHOBOS 1 - First attempt to land probes on surface of Mars\\' largest\\n\\t       moon, Phobos. Probe failed enroute in 1988 due to\\n\\t       human/computer error.\\n    PHOBOS 2 - Attempt to land probes on Martian moon Phobos. The probe did\\n\\t       enter Mars orbit in early 1989, but signals ceased one week\\n\\t       before scheduled Phobos landing.\\n\\n    While there has been talk of Soviet Jupiter, Saturn, and even\\n    interstellar probes within the next thirty years, no major steps have\\n    yet been taken with these projects. More intensive studies of the Moon,\\n    Mars, Venus, and various comets have been planned for the 1990s, and a\\n    Mercury mission to orbit and land probes on the tiny world has been\\n    planned for 2003. How the many changes in the former Soviet Union (now\\n    the Commonwealth of Independent States) will affect the future of their\\n    space program remains to be seen.\\n\\n\\nJAPANESE PLANETARY MISSIONS\\n\\n    SAKIGAKE (MS-T5) was launched from the Kagoshima Space Center by ISAS on\\n    January 8 1985, and approached Halley\\'s Comet within about 7 million km\\n    on March 11, 1986. The spacecraft is carrying three instru- ments to\\n    measure interplanetary magnetic field/plasma waves/solar wind, all of\\n    which work normally now, so ISAS made an Earth swingby by Sakigake on\\n    January 8, 1992 into an orbit similar to the earth\\'s. The closest\\n    approach was at 23h08m47s (JST=UTC+9h) on January 8, 1992. The\\n    geocentric distance was 88,997 km. This is the first planet-swingby for\\n    a Japanese spacecraft.\\n\\n    During the approach, Sakigake observed the geotail. Some geotail\\n    passages will be scheduled in some years hence. The second Earth-swingby\\n    will be on June 14, 1993 (at 40 Re (Earth\\'s radius)), and the third\\n    October 28, 1994 (at 86 Re).\\n\\n\\n    HITEN, a small lunar probe, was launched into Earth orbit on January 24,\\n    1990. The spacecraft was then known as MUSES-A, but was renamed to Hiten\\n    once in orbit. The 430 lb probe looped out from Earth and made its first\\n    lunary flyby on March 19, where it dropped off its 26 lb midget\\n    satellite, HAGOROMO. Japan at this point became the third nation to\\n    orbit a satellite around the Moon, joining the Unites States and USSR.\\n\\n    The smaller spacecraft, Hagoromo, remained in orbit around the Moon. An\\n    apparently broken transistor radio caused the Japanese space scientists\\n    to lose track of it. Hagoromo\\'s rocket motor fired on schedule on March\\n    19, but the spacecraft\\'s tracking transmitter failed immediately. The\\n    rocket firing of Hagoromo was optically confirmed using the Schmidt\\n    camera (105-cm, F3.1) at the Kiso Observatory in Japan.\\n\\n    Hiten made multiple lunar flybys at approximately monthly intervals and\\n    performed aerobraking experiments using the Earth\\'s atmosphere. Hiten\\n    made a close approach to the moon at 22:33 JST (UTC+9h) on February 15,\\n    1992 at the height of 423 km from the moon\\'s surface (35.3N, 9.7E) and\\n    fired its propulsion system for about ten minutes to put the craft into\\n    lunar orbit. The following is the orbital calculation results after the\\n    approach:\\n\\n\\tApoapsis Altitude: about 49,400 km\\n\\tPeriapsis Altitude: about 9,600 km\\n\\tInclination\\t: 34.7 deg (to ecliptic plane)\\n\\tPeriod\\t\\t: 4.7 days\\n\\n\\nPLANETARY MISSION REFERENCES\\n\\n    I also recommend reading the following works, categorized in three\\n    groups: General overviews, specific books on particular space missions,\\n    and periodical sources on space probes. This list is by no means\\n    complete; it is primarily designed to give you places to start your\\n    research through generally available works on the subject. If anyone can\\n    add pertinent works to the list, it would be greatly appreciated.\\n\\n    Though naturally I recommend all the books listed below, I think it\\n    would be best if you started out with the general overview books, in\\n    order to give you a clear idea of the history of space exploration in\\n    this area. I also recommend that you pick up some good, up-to-date\\n    general works on astronomy and the Sol system, to give you some extra\\n    background.

According to  sources close\\n       to Mossad, about 700 Kurdish, Greek Cypriot and Armenian\\n       militants  are   undergoing  training  in   the  Troodos\\n       mountains in  southern Cyprus.  The same  sources stated\\n       that Abu  Nidal\\'s special  advisers are  giving military\\n       training to  the PKK and  ASALA militants in  the camps.\\n       They added that the  militants leave southern Cyprus for\\n       Libya, Lebanon, Syria, Greece  and Iran after completing\\n       their training.  Mossad has established that  due to the\\n       clashes  which were  taking  place  among the  terrorist\\n       groups based  in Syria, the PKK  and ASALA organisations\\n       moved to  the Greek Cypriot  part of Cyprus,  where they\\n       would  be  more  comfortable.

The offices are used to provide  material\\n       support for the  Armenian  camps.

They  added  that  he\\n       instructed  his militants  to sever their links with the\\n       PKK  and avoid clashing with it.

In fact, JPL is actively\\ninvolved in the study of ozone and the atmosphere in three\\nimportant ways,\" said Dr. Jim Margitan, principal investigator on\\nthe balloon research campaign.  \\n\\n     \"There are two JPL instruments on the UARS satellite,\" he\\ncontinued.  \"The ATMOS experiment is conducted by JPL scientists,\\nand the JPL balloon research provides collaborative ground truth\\nfor those activities, as well as data that is useful in its own\\nright.\"\\n\\n     The measurements taken by the balloon payload will add more\\npieces to the complex puzzle of the atmosphere, specifically the\\nmid-latitude stratosphere during winter and spring. \\nUnderstanding the chemistry occurring in this region helps\\nscientists construct more accurate computer models which are\\ninstrumental in predicting future ozone conditions.\\n\\n     The scientific balloon payload consisted of three JPL\\ninstruments:  an ultraviolet ozone photometer which measures\\nozone as the balloon ascends and descends through the atmosphere;\\na submillimeterwave limb sounder which looks at microwave\\nradiation emitted by molecules in the atmosphere; and a Fourier\\ntransform infrared interferometer which monitors how the\\natmosphere absorbs sunlight. \\n\\n     Launch occurred at about noontime, and following a three-\\nhour ascent, the balloon floated eastward at approximately 130\\nkilometers per hour (70 knots).  Data was radioed to ground\\nstations and recorded onboard.  The flight ended at 10 p.m.\\nPacific time in eastern New Mexico when the payload was commanded\\nto separate from the balloon.\\n\\n     \"We needed to fly through sunset to make the infrared\\nmeasurements,\" Margitan explained, \"and we also needed to fly in\\ndarkness to watch how quickly some of the molecules disappear.\"\\n\\n     It will be several weeks before scientists will have the\\ncompleted results of their experiments.  They will then forward\\ntheir data to the UARS central data facility at the Goddard Space\\nFlight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland for use by the UARS\\nscientists.    \\n\\n     The balloon was launched by the National Scientific Balloon\\nFacility, normally based in Palestine, Tex., operating under a\\ncontract from NASA\\'s Wallops Flight Facility.  The balloon was\\nlaunched in California because of the west-to-east wind direction\\nand the desire to keep the operation in the southwest.\\n\\n     The balloons are made of 20-micron (0.8 mil, or less than\\none-thousandth of an inch) thick plastic, and are 790,000 cubic\\nmeters (28 million cubic feet) in volume when fully inflated with\\nhelium (120 meters (400 feet) in diameter).  The balloons weigh\\nbetween 1,300 and 1,800 kilograms (3,000 and 4,000 pounds).  The\\nscientific payload weighs about 1,300 kilograms (3,000) pounds\\nand is 1.8 meters (six feet) square by 4.6 meters (15 feet) high.\\n\\n     The JPL balloon research is sponsored by NASA\\'s Upper\\nAtmosphere Research Program and the UARS Correlative Measurements\\nProgram.                        \\n\\n                              #####\\n     ___    _____     ___\\n    /_ /|  /____/ \\\\  /_ /|     Ron Baalke         | baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov\\n    | | | |  __ \\\\ /| | | |     Jet Propulsion Lab |\\n ___| | | | |__) |/  | | |__   M/S 525-3684 Telos | Being cynical never helps \\n/___| | | |  ___/    | |/__ /| Pasadena, CA 91109 | to correct the situation \\n|_____|/  |_|/       |_____|/                     | and causes more aggravation\\n                                                  | instead.\\n',\n",

Firstly, motorcycles do not steer\\nthemselves - only the rider can do that. Secondly, it is the adhesion of the\\ntyre on the road, the suspension geometry  and the ground clearance of the\\n motorcycle which dictate how quickly you can swerve to avoid obstacles, and\\nnot the knowledge of physics between the rider\\'s ears.

This regardless of the amount of experience\\n>they brought into the course (ranging from 10 minutes to 10+ years).\\n\\nFormal training in this country (as far as I am aware) does not include\\ncountersteering theory.  I found out about countersteering about six years ago,\\nfrom a physics lecturer who was also a motorcyclist. I didn\\'t believe him\\nat first when he said I steered my bike to the right to make it turn left,\\nbut I went out and analysed closely what I was doing, and realized he was \\nright! It\\'s an interesting bit of knowledge, and I\\'ve had a lot of fun since\\nthen telling others about it, who were at first as sceptical as I was. But\\nthat\\'s all it is - an interesting bit of knowledge, and to claim that\\nit is essential for all bikers to know it, or that you can corner faster\\nor better as a result, is absurd.\\n\\nFormal training is in my view absolutely essential if you\\'re going to\\nbe able to ride a bike properly and safely.
